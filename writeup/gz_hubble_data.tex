\section{Introduction}

The morphology of galaxies encodes information on the orbital parameters and assembly history of the contents, including gas, dust, stars, and the central black hole. The morphology is also closely related to the local environment of the galaxy, as mutual interactions such as gravitational tides, shocks in cluster environments and direct mergers can all change the shape of the galaxy's potential. For $M^\star$~galaxies in the local Universe, this typically manifests at the most basic level as the difference between bulge-dominated, virialized systems resembling ellipticals (early-types) and disk-dominated, rotationally-supported disks (late-types) frequently exhibiting spiral arms. This dichotomy has been used to explore much of the astrophysics encoding galaxy formation and evolution, and has been shown to be closely linked with other galactic properties such as stellar mass, halo mass, luminosity, black hole activity, size, and the relative ages of the stellar populations. 

The advent of larger telescopes in an increasing range of observing wavelengths has revealed that the distribution and properties of galaxy morphology have strongly evolved over the lifetime of the Universe. At redshift $z\simeq1$ (roughly 6~Gyr after the Big Bang), many galaxies are still in the process of assembling the baryonic mass required to reproduce the structures seen in the present day. This occurs in a variety of pathways, including accretion of baryons from large-scale galactic filaments onto halos via streaming, mergers of individual dark matter halos along with their baryons, conversion of gas into stars via gravitational collapse and star formation, etc. The process can also be slowed or even reversed via feedback from stellar winds, supernovae, and active black holes. Each of these processes affects on the galaxy morphology, and so an accurate measurement of the demographics as a function of redshift provides an extremely powerful observational constraint on the physics taking place \citep[for a recent review see][]{con14}. 

Theoretical predictions for the morphology of galaxies as a function of redshift are primarily computed within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework. Full treatments of this model gravitational interactions between baryons and dark matter, hydrodynamics of the gas, and baryonic physics related to star formation and evolution. The most advanced simulations now include volumes up to $\sim100$~Mpc$^3$ while simultaneously resolving the smaller scales necessary to reproduce the baryonic physics \citep{vog14a,sch15}. Such simulations predict clustering of galaxies on large scales in a hierarchical assembly model \citep{sil12}. The structure of individual galaxies is affected by the merger history \citep{too72,hop10}, local environment \citep[such as the morphology-density relation;][]{dre80}, initial dark halo mass, and many other factors. Morphologies of individial simulated high-mass galaxies at $z\sim2-3$ commonly show kpc-scale ``clumpy'' structures and few galaxies that are either smooth or well-ordered spirals; asymmetric profiles with strong density constrasts dominate down to at least $z\gtrsim$ \citep{gen14}. 

Observational studies of galaxies at high-redshift also display a wide range of morphological types, many of which are rare or absent at $z\sim0$. These include spheroids and disks (akin to the ellipticals/spirals seen in the local Universe), but also a significant population of massive, more irregular galaxies, including mergers, tadpoles, chains, double-clumps, and clump-clusters \citep{elm05,elm07,cam11a,for11a,kar15}. In contrast, while grand-design spirals have been observed as far back as $z=2.18$ \citep{law12}, their spatial density suggests that they are exceedingly rare, with a very low overall disk fraction \citep{mor13}. Current observational data thus strongly suggests that the classical Hubble sequence/tuning fork \citep{hub36} is not a suitable framework for characterizing high-redshift morphology. 

Space-based observatories, particularly the \hubble, have been responsible for the bulk of imaging studies of high-redshift galaxies. Observations of fixed fields with very deep imaging \citep[eg,][]{wil96,gia04,bec06,dav07,sco07,gro11} give the photometric sensitivity necessary to detect $L^\star$ galaxies at $z>1$, while also providing the angular resolution to distinguish internal structure and characterize the morphology. While these measurements are helped by the fact that the angular diameter distance is relatively flat at $z>1$ in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the scales are only of the order $\sim5-10~\mathrm{kpc}/^{\prime\prime}$ \citep{wri06}. \hst{} can thus resolve much of the structure for a Milky Way-sized galaxy (at least for distinguishing a disk from a bulge), but will be limited for more compact structures. Since the size of galaxies evolves as roughly $r\propto(1+z)^{-1}$ \citep{law12a}, the more compact sizes of earlier galaxies make detailed morphologies a challenge even for \hst{} \citep{che12}. The public availability of more than $10^5$~galaxies in archival imaging across various studies gives a data sample with the potential for high statistical significance. 

One of the major difficulties in studying the morphologies of galaxies in large samples lies in the system of measurement. Visual classification by experts has been used for many years \citep[eg,][]{hub26,dev59,san61,van76,nai10,bai11,kar15}. These methods have advantages in using the significant processing power of the human brain to identify patterns, but suffer from issues such as lack of scaling to large surveys and potential issues with replicability and calibration. Automated measurements, both parametric \citep{pen02a,sim11,lac12} and non-parametric \citep{con03,lot04,sca07,bam08,fre13}, scale well to arbitrary sample sizes, but do not always fully capture the relevant features, especially for asymmetric galaxies that become increasingly common at high redshifts. The Galaxy Zoo project \citep{lin08,lin11} utilizes crowdsourced visual classifications to measure galaxies in color-composite images. With $>2\times10^5$~classifiers, this allows for multiple independent classifications of each image which are combined and calibrated to give a distribution of vote fractions proportional to the probability of a feature being visible. While the crowdsourced data require extensive calibration \citep{bam09,wil13}, they have a proven reliability and have been used in dozens of papers \citep[eg,][]{lan08,bam09,dar10,mas11c,ski12,sim13,sch14,wil15}. 

This paper presents the results from the Galaxy Zoo Hubble (GZH) project. GZH was the third phase of Galaxy Zoo, following its initial results classifying $\sim900,000$~SDSS~images into primarily early/late~types \citep{lin11} and Galaxy~Zoo~2, which covered $\sim250,000$~SDSS~images using a more detailed classification scheme that included bars, spiral arms, and galactic bulges \citep{wil13}. GZH used a similarly detailed classification scheme, but focused for the first time on images of high-redshift galaxies taken with the \hubble.

We describe the sample selection and creation of the images used for GZH in Section~\ref{sec:data}. Section~\ref{sec:interface} describes the GZH interface and the collection of classifications. Section~\ref{sec:debiasing} outlines the process used to calibrate and ``debias'' the crowdsourced votes. Section~\ref{sec:results} gives the main results as a catalog, with several examples of how the data may be queried in Section~\ref{sec:cookbook}. Section~\ref{sec:analysis} gives a short overview of the observed morphological demographics and compares them to several other catalogs, with a summary in Section~\ref{sec:summary}.

This paper uses the WMAP9 cosmology parameters of $(\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda,h)=(0.258,0.718,0.697)$ \citep{hin13}.

\section{Sample and Data}\label{sec:data}

The GZH project contains images drawn from a number of different dedicated surveys and sample selection criteria, which we describe below. The majority of the images (as implied by the project name) are taken directly from \hst{} Legacy Surveys.

\begin{figure*}

\subsection{Summary of Hubble Legacy Survey Imaging}\label{ssec:legacy_surveys}

\begin{itemize}
\item \hubble{} ACS imaging for the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey \citep[AEGIS;][]{dav07} covers a strip centered at $\alpha=14^\textrm{h}17^\textrm{m}, \delta=+52^\circ30^\prime$. The strip was originally selected due to low extinction and Galactic/zodiacal emission, making it a prime target for multi-wavelength observations by space-based observatories. The ACS images covered 63 separate tiles over a total area of $\sim710$~arcmin$^2$. Images were in two bands, with exposure times of 2300~seconds in F606W (\Vband) and 2100~seconds in F814W (\Iband). The final mosaic images are dithered to a resolution of 0.03~\arcsec/pixel. For extended objects, the limiting magnitudes of sources in AEGIS are 26.23~(AB) in \Vband{} and 25.61 (AB) in \Iband. 

\item The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey \citep[GOODS;][]{gia04} covers two well-studied fields in the northern and southern hemispheres: the Hubble Deep Field-North ($\alpha=12^\textrm{h}36^\textrm{m}, \delta=+62^\circ14^\prime$) and the Chandra Deep Field-South ($\alpha=03^\textrm{h}32^\textrm{m}, \delta=-27^\circ48^\prime$). Data including Hubble ACS images are referred to as GOODS-N and GOODS-S, respectively. ACS imaged the GOODS fields in 4 filters -- F435W (\Bband), \Vband, F775W (\iband), and F850LP (\zband). The mean exposure times for each epoch vary by band, from 1050--2100~seconds. The \Bband{} images were completed in a single epoch at the beginning of the survey, but the \Vband, \iband, and \zband{} images were taken in five separate epochs separated by 40--50~days each. The ACS images are dithered to a pixel scale of 0.03~\arcsec/pixel and covers a total area of $\sim320$~arcmin$^2$ (160~arcmin$^2$ per field). The $5\sigma$ limiting magnitudes for extended sources are 25.7 for \Vband{} and 25.0 for \iband. 

\item The Cosmic Evolution Survey \citep[COSMOS;][]{sco07} covers an area of $\sim1.8$~deg$^2$ centered at $\alpha=10^\textrm{h}00^\textrm{m}28^\textrm{s}, \delta=+02^\circ12^\prime21^{\prime\prime}$. Its location near the celestial equator was designed to enable coverage by ground-based telescopes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as the space-based observatories. The \hst{} ACS data from COSMOS consists of 1 orbit with 2028~seconds per pointing in \Iband, consisting of 590 total pointings. The image resolution is dithered to 0.05~\arcsec/pixel. The 50\% completeness magnitude for a galaxy with a half-light radius of $0^{\prime\prime}.50$ in \Iband{} is 24.7 mag. 

\item The Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and SEDS \citep[GEMS;][]{rix04,cal08} survey is also centered on the Chandra Deep Field-South. The GEMS data covers $\sim800$~arcmin$^2$, and surrounds the area covered by GOODS-S. Images from ACS in GEMS have 1 orbit per pointing for a total of 63~pointings. The exposure times are 2160 and 2286~seconds in \Vband{} and \zband{}, respectively. The image resolution has a pixel scale of 0.03~\arcsec/pixel. The $5\sigma$ limiting magnitudes for source detection are 25.7 AB in \Vband{} and 24.2~AB in \zband.

\subsection{Galaxy selection}

For images from the ACS-GC \citet{gri12}, galaxies are identified using a combination of \sextractor{} \citep{ber96} and the galaxy-profile fitting framework \textsc{Galapagos} \citep{bar12}. We selected all galaxies with $m < 23.5$, where $m$ is in the \Iband, \zband, or \iband{} for the AEGIS + COSMOS, GEMS + GOODS-S, and GOODS-N surveys, respectively. This yielded a total of 113,166~images (Table~\ref{tbl:gzh_numbers}).

Single-epoch images from SDSS Stripe~82 were selected using the same criteria from \citet{wil13}, which required limits of \texttt{petroR90\_r}$ > 3$\arcsec~(where \texttt{petroR90\_r} is the radius containing 90\% of the $r^\prime$ Petrosian flux) and a magnitude brighter than $m_r < 17.77$. 21,522 galaxies in SDSS met these criteria. Coadded images from Stripe~82 were selected from the union of galaxies with coadded magnitudes brighter than $17.77$~mag and the galaxies detected in the single-depth images and matched to a coadd source. This resulted in a larger set of 30,339 images. Of the images in the coadded sample, 5144 (17~percent) are dimmer than the initial magnitude cut of 17.77. 

\subsection{Image creation}

The images used for classification in GZH are color-composite JPGs made from multi-band data. The exact process for creating the images depends on the bands and resolutions in the surveys. 

For galaxies in the ACS General Catalogue \citep[AEGIS, COSMOS, GEMS, 2-epoch GOODS;][]{gri12}, the color composites are made using a fixed pixel intensity scaling with weights of $[2.4\times10^{-4},3\times10^{-4},3\times10^{-4}]$ in the red, green, and blue channels respectively. We also apply a nonlinear mapping to each pixel to emphasize the contrast in faint features \citep{lup04}, taking the form of:

\begin{equation}
I_\mathrm{channel,new} = I_\mathrm{channel,old} \times \frac{\arcsinh(b\times r)}{(b\times r)}
\label{eqn:nonlinear}
\end{equation}

\noindent We adopt a value of $b=3$ for the \hst{} images in \citet{gri12}. 

Since the majority of the data in Legacy surveys described in \S\ref{ssec:legacy_surveys} had images in only 1 or 2~bands available when GZH was launched, making standard 3-channel RGB images in the same method used for the SDSS images in the original Galaxy Zoo was not possible. For surveys with images in two bands (AEGIS, GEMS, and the two-epoch GOODS-N and GOODS-S), the lower-wavelength band is mapped to the blue channel, the higher-wavelength band to the red channel, and the green channel created by taking the geometric mean of the two. Bands used in each of the surveys are listed in Table~\ref{tbl:gzh_numbers}. Note that the 2-epoch GOODS-N and GOODS-S images use different filters --- this was a deliberate choice made so that the GEMS images could be directly compared with the overlapping coverage of GOODS-S (Figure~\ref{fig:filtercurves}). 

By the time that the 5-epoch sets of GOODS data were put into GZH, coverage in four separate \hst{} bands had become publicly available. The deeper GOODS images were created using the arithmetic mean of \Bband{} and \Vband in the blue channel, \Iband{} in the red channel, and \zband in the green channel. These images also had the speckled noise pixels decolorized. 

The COSMOS images only had the \Iband{} imaging available at the time of classification in GZH. For these galaxies, we created ``pseudocolor'' images by using the ACS \Iband{} data as the illumination map and ground-based imaging from the \subaru{} telescope in $B_J$, $r^+$, and $i^+$ filters to provide the color gradients \citep[see][for further details]{gri12}. This means that the images have the angular resolution of \hst{} ($\sim0.05$~\arcsec/pixel) for the overall intensity, but the color gradients are at ground-based resolution, with seeing between 0\arcsec.95 and 1\arcsec.05 \citep{tan07}.

The Stripe~82 single-epoch images were taken directly from the color composites on the DR7 SDSS Skyserver, which combines $g^{\prime}$, $r^{\prime}$, and $i^{\prime}$ exposures into the RGB channels. The coadded Stripe~82 images were assembled from runs (106,206) in DR7 and generated into JPGs using the method of \citet{lup04}.

To address a number of images in which the sky noise was highly colored (which might have been a distraction to users), we apply a soft-edged object mask to the image that preserves the color balance for galaxies, but desaturates the speckled noise against regions of blank sky. This technique was applied only to the coadded Stripe~82 and the COSMOS images.

\subsection{Artificial AGN}

We also created a set of images designed to measure the effect of AGN on morphological classifications. Since galactic nuclei can have bright, unresolved optical emission, this has the potential to mimic the effect of a strong bulge. The presence of an AGN is simulated by modeling the PSF for \hst{} and then inserting a bright source near the center of a real galaxy. For each image, the simulated AGN is assigned one of three colors -- either blue, red, or flat (white) as seen in the color images -- and a range of brightnesses such that $L_\mathrm{ratio} \equiv L_\mathrm{galaxy}/L_\mathrm{AGN}$ is in $(0.2,1.0,2.0,5.0,10.0,50.0)$. Combining these parameters generates 15~images with different simulated AGN for each chosen host. 

Two sets of simulated AGN were generated in GZH. The first set (version~1) was assembled from 95~galaxies from GEMS imaging and PSFs from \texttt{daophot}. The second set (version~2) was assembled from 96~galaxies in GOODS-S; this version used deeper imaging and improved PSFs from \texttt{TinyTim}. 

Images with simulated AGN were classified in the main interface in an identical manner and evenly distributed with unaltered images of the galaxies. Classifiers were not explicitly told that the images had been altered, as the goal was to measure the effect on normal classifications in as unbiased a manner as possible. 

\subsection{Galaxy metadata}

Photometric data for the bulk of the GZH sample is largely drawn from the tables provided in \citet{gri12}. This includes photometric parameters from both \sextractor{} and \galfit, such as the fluxes, magnitudes, radii, ellipticities, position angles, and positions. \galfit{} also provides the parametric S\'{e}rsic index and effective half-light radius for the best-fit model. All parameters are measured in both bands of the ACS imaging, with the exception of the single-band COSMOS images.

Redshifts for the GZH catalog are compiled from a variety of sources to include in the GZH catalog. For each galaxy, the redshift selected is in the $\tt Z\_Best$ column of the data (see Table~\ref{tbl:catalog_hst}), its type (spectroscopic: $\tt SPEC\_Z$, photometric: $\tt PHOTO\_Z$, or grism: $ \tt GRISM\_Z$) is listed in the column $\tt Z\_BEST\_TYPE$, and the source catalog ($\tt ACSGC$ \citep{gri12}, $\tt 3DHST$ \citep{mom15}, $\tt MUSYC$ \citep{car10}, or $\tt UltraVISTA$ \citep{ilb13}) of the redshift is in column $\tt Z\_BEST\_SOURCE$.

For galaxies which have redshifts from multiple sources, we use the following algorithm to select the $\tt Z\_BEST$ redshift. We first prioritize spectroscopic redshifts; these are provided in the ACS-GC, 3DHST, and MUSYC catalogs. If a high quality spec-z exists in the ACS-GC. we use that, else 3DHST, else MUSYC. We show in Figure~\ref{fig:speczs} that over 98\% of the the spec-z's are consistent with each other, and therefore the priority order of selection makes no negligible difference. If no spectroscipic redshifts are available, we compare the 1-$\sigma$ errors of the photometric (ACS-GC, 3DHST, MUSYC, UltraVISTA) and grism (UltraVISTA) redshifts, and use the redshift with the smallest error. Table~\ref{tbl:redshifts} shows the results of this selection.

The number in the upper left of each plot is the percentage of redshifts which agree within $\Delta z < 0.05$ between the two catalogs being compared in each panel. Within this range there is over 98\% agreement in redshifts between all three catalogs.}

Photometric and spectroscopic data for the SDSS Stripe~82 galaxies are taken from the CasJobs DR7 tables. This includes $ugriz$ Petrosian magnitudes and fluxes, as well as the relative de~Vaucouleurs and exponential fits from the model magnitudes. Redshifts used for the Sloan galaxies are all spectroscopic. 82.6\% of galaxies in the single-depth images and 65.1\% of galaxies in the coadd images have a measured DR7 spectroscopic redshift.

\subsection{User weighting}\label{ssec:weighting}
The votes of individual users who classified galaxies in GZH are combined to make a vote fraction for each question on the classification tree. Users' votes are weighted slightly \citep[in a method identical to that described in][]{wil13} such that users who frequently disagree with all other users end up having very low weights. The user weighting $w$ is 1 for the top 95\% of users as ranked by consistency. For the bottom 5\% of users, $w$ drops smoothly and is effectively zero for only the bottom 1\% of classifiers in the CDF. The overall effect on the GZH dataset is relatively small, but this method is effective at filtering out contributions from random or delibrately malicious classifiers.

\section{Correcting for redshift-dependent classification bias}\label{sec:debiasing}

The previous versions of Galaxy Zoo morphology classifications \citep{lin08,wil13} were based on observations of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) which are typically at $z<0.1$. In these cases it was assumed that there was no cosmological evolution of the morphologies of galaxies and therefore any observed changes in the distribution of galaxies with different consensus morphologies was due to the effects of redshift on the image quality (\ie. the reduction in physical resolution, surface brightness dimming, etc). For both previous releases of GZ morphologies, we provided a correction for redshift-dependent bias based on matching the classification fractions at the highest redshfts with those at the lowest redshift. See \citet{bam09} and \citet{wil13} for the details. 

In the GZH samples, the redshift range is large enough that we expect to measure cosmological evolution of the types and morphologies of galaxies in the sample. As a result, the previous methods of correcting for redshift dependent bias will not work. In addition, the effects of band shifting will change the images even more across these redshift ranges. %Figure~\ref{fig:exampleFERENGI} illustrates some of the possible effects of losing features in spiral galaxies at high redshift. 

In order to test and correct for the effects of redshift, we generated a set of calibration images. These images consist of the same galaxy as it would appear over a variety of redshifts. The input images are from the SDSS \citep{yor00,str02} and are processed using the \ferengi{} code \citep{bar08a} to match the observational properties of the \hst{} surveys out to $z=1$. These images were classified in the Galaxy Zoo interface using the same classification scheme as the original \hst{} images.
 
\subsection{Selection of FERENGI input galaxies}

We selected 288 unique galaxies from SDSS imaging to run through the \ferengi{} code. The selection spanned a variety of galaxy morphologies (as selected by GZ2 classifications) and $r^\prime$-band surface brightnesses, and also spanned the redshift range of SDSS targets (in $N_z = 4$ bins) in order to be optimised for different target minimum redshifts in \hst{} imaging. 

The selection criteria for the different morphological categories is summarised in Table \ref{tbl:morphologies}. The surface brightness selection ($N_\mu = 3$) was (1) low: $\mu > 21.5$~\magarc;  (2) mid: $20.5 < \mu < 21.5$~\magarc; and (3) high: $\mu < 20.5$~\magarc. For each of the four ``target redshifts'' ($z = 0.3, 0.5, 0.8$ and $1.0$), the images were redshifted in $\Delta z = 0.1$ bins up to $z=1.0$.

In addition to the physical parameters of the input images, the \ferengi{} output depends on assumptions of the global galaxy evolution model. This evolution is a crude mechanism that mimics the brightness increase of galaxies with increasing redshift (out to at least $z\sim1-2$). The effect on the redshifted images is simply an empirical addition to the magnitude of a galaxy of the form $M' = e\times z + M$, where $M'$ is the corrected magnitude, and $e$ is the evolutionary correction in magnitudes (i.e., $e=-1$ essentially brightens the galaxy by 1~magnitude by $z=1$). We ran \ferengi{} for values of $e$ starting from $e=0$ and decreasing to $e=-3.5$ in increments of $\Delta e = 0.5$. Figure~\ref{fig:exampleFERENGI} shows several examples of the effects of ``losing`` spiral/disc features with increasing redshift for two galaxies with $e=0$. 

The final number of \ferengi{} images produced for each galaxy is ultimately a function of galaxy's redshift, since the new images cannot be resampled at better angular resolution than the original SDSS data, as well as the number of $e$ values selected. Table~\ref{tbl:ferengivalues} summarizes the total sample of redshifted images produced for GZH.

\subsection{Correcting GZH morphologies for classification bias}\label{ssec:zeta}

The approach used in GZH for correcting the weighted classifications for user bias rests on the assumption that the \emph{amount} of bias is a function of the apparent size and brightness of the image as seen on screen. This is controlled by two types of parameters: \textbf{intrinsic} properties of the galaxy itself, such as its physical diameter and luminosity, and \textbf{extrinsic} properties, such as the distance (redshift) of the galaxy and its relative orientation. There are likely other parameters that affect user accuracy, such as the proximity of close companions \citep[``distraction bias''; see][]{joh15} or bias as a function of the individual user. The combination of all such parameters forms a high-dimensional space, and we have insufficient data to measure their individual effects. Instead, we use just two parameters that are intended to capture the bulk of the change in bias (based on GZ1/GZ2): a galaxy's $r^\prime$-band surface brightness ($\mu_r$; intrinsic) and redshift ($z$; extrinsic). 

The change in bias as a function of $\mu_r$ and $z$ is measured using the \ferengi{} images over all the evolutionary correction factors. We assume that the ``true'' (ie, debiased) vote fraction $f_{\mu,z}$ for a galaxy can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
f_{\mu,z} = \left(f_{\mu,z=0.3}\right) \times e^{{\frac{z-z_0}{\zeta}}},
\label{eqn:fzeta}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $f_{\mu,z=0.3}$ is the ``calibrated'' vote fraction at the lowest redshift in the \ferengi{} bins ($z=0.3$) and $\zeta$ is a positive parameter that controls the rate at which $f$ decreases with increasing redshift. This formula fits the data relatively well (with almost no exceptions, the vote fractions for featured galaxies decrease monotonically with increasing redshift), and the exponential function bounds the observed vote fractions between $f_{\mu,z=0.3}$ and zero. Figure~\ref{fig:zeta_examples} show examples of the change in vote fraction and their fits to Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta} for a random selection of galaxies in the \ferengi{} images. 

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/zeta_examples.pdf}
\caption{Behavior of the normalized, weighted vote fractions of features visible in a galaxy ($f_\textrm{features}$) as a function of redshift in the artifical \ferengi{} images. Galaxies are a random selection of images with $e=0$ and at least three detectable images in redshift bins of $z\ge0.3$. The measured vote fractions (red points) are fit with an exponential function (Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta}); the best-fit parameters are given above each plot. Error bars are Poissonian, assuming a median of 40~votes per galaxy.}
\label{fig:zeta_examples}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

We use the values of $\zeta$ for \emph{all} sets of artifically redshifted galaxies to fit the overall distribution as a function of surface brightness, since we expect the correction being applied to vary as a function of the intrinsic galaxy properties. We restrict the galaxies that can be used to measure the calibration to those with data at the pivot redshift of $z=0.3$, non-zero $f_\textrm{features}$ at $z=0.3$, and with a reasonable fit to the exponential model ($\Delta \chi^2 > 3.0$). 

Figure~\ref{fig:zeta_mu} shows the results of fitting the \ferengi{} images with Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta}; the correction is a weak function of galaxy surface brightness. Higher-surface brightness galaxies have stronger average corrections, likely because these galaxies are more likely to have larger $f_\textrm{features}$ values at high redshifts. Low surface brightness galaxies are more likely to begin low and remain low; the bounded nature of the dropoff (and Poissonian-like variance among the individual voters) means that the average magnitude of $\zeta$ will be less.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{figures/zeta_mu.pdf}
\caption{All fits for the vote fraction dropoff parameter $\zeta$ for $f_\textrm{features}$ in the \ferengi{} galaxies as a function of surface brightness.

\label{fig:zeta_mu}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We fit the data in Figure~\ref{fig:zeta_mu} with a linear function such that:

\begin{equation}
\log_{10}(\hat\zeta) = \zeta_0 + (\zeta_1 \times \mu),
\label{eqn:zetafit}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\hat\zeta$ is the correction factor applied to each galaxy as a function of surface brightness. The best-fit parameters to the linear fit (from least-squares optimization) are $\zeta_0=0.1$, $\zeta_1=1.4$. To make the final debiased correction, we modify the simple exponential form of Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta} to bound the debiased vote fractions between $f$ and 1:

\begin{equation}
f_\textrm{features,debiased} = 1 - (1 - f)e^{\frac{z-z_0}{\hat\zeta}}.
\label{eqn:fzeta_mod}
\end{equation}

\label{fig:p_vs_p}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:p_vs_p} we examine the change in \pfeatures{} for the \ferengi{} galaxies relative to their lowest simulated redshift. In this analysis, only galaxies whose lowest simulated redshift image was ($\rm z_{sim}=0.3$) were used (see Table \ref{tbl:ferengivalues}), and only those which had detectable surface brightness measurements in \sextractor; this includes 3,950 of the total 6,466 images. For each simulated redshift value $z$, and at a fixed surface brightness $\mu$, we plot \pfeaturesz, the value measured at that simulated redshift, vs \pfeaturesrest, the value measured for the same galaxy imaged at $z=0.3$. 
 
Our objective is to use these data to predict, for a galaxy with a measured \pfeaturesz{} value, what its \pfeatures{} value \emph{would have been} if it had been viewed at $z=0.3$. This predicted value is defined as the debiased vote fraction \pfeaturesdebiased, and is calculated by applying a correction to the measured value of \pfeatures, determined by the $\zeta$ function described in the previous section. A reliable predicted value can be obtained so long as the relationship between \pfeaturesz{} and \pfeaturesrest{} is single-valued; that is, for a given \pfeaturesz, there is exactly one corresponding value of \pfeatures{} at $z=0.3$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:p_vs_p} shows that the relationship between \pfeaturesz{} and \pfeaturesrest{} is \emph{not} always single valued; hence, it is not appropriate to correct galaxies that lie in certain regions of surface brightness/redshift/\pfeatures{} space. These regions tend to have low \pfeatures{} values at high redshift, but a wide range of values at $z=0.3$. These regions contain two morphological types of galaxies: First are genuine ellipticals, which have low values of \pfeatures{} at both high and low redshift. Second are disks whose features become washed out at high redshift; hence their \pfeatures{} value at $z=0.3$ may be quite high, while the value observed at high redshift is very low. This effect is strongest at high $z$ and low $\mu$, where features become nearly impossible to discern in the images.

Our criteria for determining whether a region of this space is single-valued, and therefore correctable, is as follows: In each surface brightness and redshift bin, we model the relationship between \pfeaturesz{} and \pfeaturesrest{} by fitting the data with a polynomials of degrees 3, 2, and 1, and use the best fit out of the three. These fits are shown as the dashed black lines in Figure~\ref{fig:6a}. Any flat regions of the polynomial fits are areas in which there is not a clear single-valued relationship between \pfeaturesz{} and \pfeaturesrest; we quantify this by setting a minimum slope cut of 0.4. Any data in which the polynomial fit has a slope less than this value is considered \emph{not} one-to-one, and therefore ``uncorrectable.'' These regions are highlighted in blue in Figure~\ref{fig:6a}. Uncolored (white) regions of the plot have sufficiently high slopes for us to consider the relationship to be single-valued; galaxies in these regions are considered ``correctable'', and only these are used in measuring the parameters for the $\zeta$ function (Section~\ref{ssec:zeta}). Only surface brightness/redshift bins with at least 5 galaxies were considered; regions with fewer than 5 galaxies we consider to have ``not enough information'' to determine the \pfeaturesz{} and \pfeaturesrest{} relationship, colored gray in Figure~\ref{fig:6a}.

The unshaded regions in Figure~\ref{fig:6a} define discrete ranges of redshift, surface brightness, and \pfeatures{} a galaxy must have in order for the $\zeta$ approach to be confidentely applied to a galaxy in the GZH sample. While the appropriate correctable regions were defined discretely, we assume the true correctable region is a smooth function of z, $\mu$, and \pfeatures{}. To define this smooth space, we generate a convex hull that encloses the correctable and uncorrectable \ferengi{} galaxies in $z$-$\mu$-\pfeatures{} space. The boundaries are then adjusted until the contamination from both groups is minimized. We use the resulting hulls to define the correctable and uncorrectable regions for categorizing the \hst{} galaxies. The results of this method and final categorization of the \hst{} sample is displayed in Table~\ref{tbl:hubble_debiasable}. We find that of the galaxies at redshift higher than $z=z_{0}=0.3$, 17\% of these are able to be debiased using the $\zeta$ method, 27\% cannot be debiased, and 56\% cannot be determined, due to a lack of redshift or information or due to a lack of \ferengi{} data corresponding to those galaxies' redshift/surface brightness values.

For the ``uncorrectable'' galaxies, those for which we cannot confidentely assign a single debiased \pfeatures{} value, we instead determine a likely \emph{range} of debiased values, using a method visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:6c}. Here we again use the \ferengi{} simulated data to analyze the range of intrinsic \pfeaturesrest{} values for any given observed \pfeatures{} value, again as a function of surface brightness and redshift. In each z,$\mu$ bin, we examine the spread of intrinsic values of \pfeaturesrest{} for 4 ranges of observed \pfeatures. We quantify the range of intrinsic values as the inner 80\% of the data; this range is represented by the orange bars in Figure~\ref{fig:6c}. For any galaxy which can't be directly debiased by the $\zeta$ method, then, we use these ranges to denote the upper and lower limits on what we expect \pfeaturesrest{} to be for any observed value of \pfeatures.

\subsection{Challenges of debiasing questions beyond ``smooth or features''}

As with the HST images, each FERENGI subject has a varying number of users answering the various questions in the hierarchical decision tree. Every user answers the first question, ``Is the galaxy smooth and rounded, with no sign of a disk?''; as such the vote fractions $\rm p_{smooth}, p_{features}$, and $\rm p_{artifact}$ are all computed with the minimum statistical error for any question, with roughly 40 total answers (see Section~\ref{sec:interface}). The number of users to answer any subsequent question, however, is always equal to or less than the number to answer the preceding question. The average number of responses per task for fourth- or fifth-tier questions such as spiral arm structure (Tasks 12--14) is only $4\pm4$ for the FERENGI sample; while this is distribution is strongly bimodal (reflecting the true morphologies of selected galaxies), the very low absolute numbers of votes introduce very high variance when attempting to calculate a statistical correction.

In the FERENGI data, these numbers severely limit the amount of information we can extract for the higher-tier questions. The debiasing technique used (Section~\ref{ssec:zeta}) require that at least 5~users answer each question for a galaxy image at $z=0.3$ \emph{and} its image at higher redshift. This requirement placed on both images is not met by a significant number of galaxies for questions beyond Task~01. The FERENGI images classified do not have sufficient numbers of objects in the surface brightness/redshift bins to accurately measure if the relation between vote fractions and redshift is single-valued.  

for this reason we only offer debiased vote fractions for Task~01 (smooth/features/artifact). 

{\note Perhaps compute number of galaxies that can be fit to zeta for each question, show a table? overkill?} 

In Section \ref{sec:ferengi_bar} we show results of an attempt to measure $\zeta$ for $\rm p_{bar}$. 

{\note
\begin{itemize}
\item talk about where the \hst{} sample falls in this space, reference Table~\ref{tbl:hubble_debiasable} 
\item justify $N>5$ and spread $< 0.2$ (or find a better way to choose criteria)
\item check out corrections for correctable and NEI, show some sample images of corrected galaxies
\item show some data for $\pbar$, determine or justify why we won't debias them  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Morphological measurements in GZH beyond Task 1 - effects of debiasing?}
\subsection{Duplicate images}

\section{The catalog}\label{sec:results}

The data release for GZH includes morphological data for 181,101~images (generated from a total of 150,771~unique galaxies). The full table can be accessed at \url{http://data.galaxyzoo.org}. We also include a secondary metadata table, which contains data from a variety of sources explained in Section \ref{sec:data}.

Each image is listed under a unique project ID (eg AHZ000001); the actual galaxy in the image is identified by the combination of the OBJNO and original survey. For each of the 55~responses in the GZH decision tree, the following classification data is provided: for each question, $\tt N_{votes}$ is the number of users to answer that question. For each unique answer, $\tt fraction$ is the fraction of users to select that answer ($\rm N_{answer}/N_{votes}$, and $\tt weighted$ is the weighted fraction, which takes into account user consistency (Section~\ref{ssec:weighting}). 

The GZH vote fractions can be largely dependent on the resolution of the image. Two otherwise morphologically identical galaxies which differ significantly in redshift, brightness, or size may result in very different vote fractions for any given question, given that many features of a galaxy are difficult to discern in less-resolved images (bars, spiral arms, disk structure, etc). For this reason, it is necessary to take caution utilizing vote fractions as cut-offs to determine morphological structure; we offer guidelines for careful classification in Section~\ref{sec:cookbook}. 

We corrected for the biases described for the first question of the GZH decision tree, which asks ``Is the galaxy smooth and round, with no sign of a disk?'' The method is described in Section~\ref{sec:debiasing}. For this question, we provide the additional parameters $\tt debiased$, $\tt lower~limit$, $\tt upper~limit$, and $\tt best$ vote fractions. The $\tt best$ fraction for $p_{features}$is chosen based on the categorization of the galaxy: if it is ``correctable'', $\tt best = debiased$, if ``uncorrectable'', $\tt best = lower~limit$, and if neither, $\tt best = weighted$. 

The debiased and best vote fractions for $\tt p_{smooth}$ were calculated on the critera that vote fractions for all answers must sum to unity. Explicitely: $\tt p_{smooth} = 1 - p_{features} - p_{artifact}$. In some rare cases, representing  $<1\%$ of the sample, this requirement resulted in negative vote fractions for $\rm p_{smooth}$; these were cases in which the $\rm p_{features}$ vote fraction was boosted to a high value relative to the $\rm p_{artifact}$ vote fraction. In these cases, we enforce the restriction that the vote fractions must sum to 1 by raising $\rm p_{smooth}$ to a vote fraction of 0.0 and decreasing $\rm p_{features}$ accordingly. This correction was typically very small, with a median decrease/increase of $\rm p_{features}/p_{smooth}$ of $\Delta p = 0.04$.

We split the data products for GZH by the type of image being classified. Table~\ref{tbl:catalog_hst} contains the classifications for the \hst{} images from the AEGIS, COSMOS, and GEMS surveys, as well as 5-epoch deep imaging from the GOODS-N and GOODS-S surveys. This contains 118,425~galaxies and is the primary output from the GZH project. The next two tables have data for a small subset of 3,927~COSMOS~images that were re-processed to study the effect of color balance on morphological classification. Table~\ref{tbl:catalog_faded} has images that are desaturated to minimize the color contrast; Table~\ref{tbl:catalog_recoloured} has images with the red and blue color channels inverted. Table~\ref{tbl:catalog_goods_shallow} contains data for 6,144~galaxies with 2-epoch images from GOODS. These have been mostly supplanted in the main table with deeper 5-epoch GOODS imaging; however, there are 1,683~galaxies in the shallower imaging that were not classified in the deeper mosaics. This data can also be compared to the counterparts in Table~\ref{tbl:catalog_hst} to study the effect of depth on morphological classification. Tables~\ref{tbl:stripe82_single} and \ref{tbl:stripe82_coadd} contain data for the SDSS Stripe~82 single-depth and co-added images, respectively, that were classified using the GZH interface and decision tree. Finally, Table~\ref{tbl:fake_agn} contains classifications for images with artificial point sources intended to simulate the effect of a bright AGN, as used in \citet{sim14}.

\section{Using the catalog}\label{sec:cookbook}

The intended purpose of the GZH catalog is to provide a simple, yet flexible, means of identifying samples of galaxies with a desired morphological type. Here we provide instructions for creating such samples using the vote fractions corresponding to the tasks shown in Figure~\ref{fig:decisiontree}. We stress that the selection process will vary based on the particular science case. More conservative cuts can be applied to create pure, but not necessarily complete, samples. These are useful for selecting galaxies exhibiting unique morphologies for individual case studies or observing proposals. Looser cuts can be applied to obtain samples with a higher level of completeness, which will increase the sample size but can potentially decrease purity. Population studies would make use of such large samples, in which statistical significance is a crucial factor in evaluating results. \citet{mas11c,mel14}, and \citet{gal15} are examples of GZ papers which select morphologies in this way. 

In GZH, volunteers answer questions about a galaxy's morphology in a decision tree format. With this structure, questions shown to a user are dependent on their answers to the previous questions. For example, a user is only asked Task 11, ``How many spiral arms?'' if they had answered ``yes'' to Task 10, which asks whether any spiral arms are present. This structure is used to reduce the workload of the users by only asking questions relevant to the particular galaxy; in this example, it would not be useful, nor would it make physical sense, to ask a user how many spiral arms in a galaxy which they had declared had no spiral arms to begin with. Figure~\ref{fig:decisiontree} shows the possible paths available for answering the questions offered in GZH. The colors represent the tier level of Tasks, which indicate the number of previous Tasks the given Task is dependent upon. The arm-number question, Task 11, is a 5th tier Task, meaning that whether this question is seen by a user is dependent on four Tasks preceding it. In this case, it is only shown to volunteers who voted the galaxy was featured/disk-shaped in Task 01, not clumpy in Task 12, not edge-on in Task 02, and had spiral structure in Task 10.  

To select galaxies of a morphological type identified with a particular Task, a cut is placed on the vote fraction for that Task ($p_{\rm task}$), \emph{as well as} the vote fractions for the Tasks preceding it, because of the dependency induced by the decision-tree structure. For example, to select barred galaxies, a cut may be placed on $p_{\rm bar}$ such that only galaxies where a high fraction of votes for this task voted for the $bar,yes$ answer. This is not the only necessary cut, however, since not all users answer this question; only those who have previously selected ``features'' in Task~01, ``not clumpy'' in Task~12, and ``not edge-on'' in Task~02 will have the opportunity to vote on the bar question, Task~03. To ensure that $p_{\rm bar}$ is well-sampled, cuts on all previous tasks must be applied. 

The flexibility of this catalog allows the user to set their own selection criteria for vote fraction thresholds to create a morphologically-pure sample. In Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds} we offer baseline cuts for selecting galaxies of a variety of morphologies. We detemined these thresholds by a visual inspection of subsamples. For each Task, we first required that at least 20 users voted on the given question. We then applied a cut on the vote fraction for the previous task and analyzed a subsample of 50 galaxies meeting these criteria, as well as a control sample of galaxies which had 20 users vote on the task, but did not meet the threshold cut set for the previous task. The threshold cut was adjusted and new subsamples were inspected until both the original and control samples achieved $\ge 80\%$ purity.

As an example of how to use Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds} to create a sample of 3-armed spirals galaxies, one should select objects with $N_{arm~number} \ge 20$, $p_{\rm features}>0.23, p_{\rm clumpy,no} > 0.30, p_{edgeon,no}>0.25$, and $p_{spiral,yes}>0.25$. These cuts define a sample of galaxies of ``arm number candidates''; ie galaxies for which answering the arm number question makes physical sense and the vote fraction $p_{\rm arm~number}$ is well-sampled. In this example, such galaxies are featured, non-clumpy, non-edge~on, spiral galaxies. At this point a cut can be made on $p_{\rm arm~number=3}$ to select spirals with 3 arms. 

Tasks 03, 04 and 05 have an additional possible pathway; as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:decisiontree}, a user might also be shown this question if they select ``featured/disk'' in Task 01, ``clumpy'' in Task 12, two or more clumps in Task 16, and ``spiral arrangement'' in Task 15. By applying the appropriate thresholds for this path, we find that $< 0.5\%$ of the galaxies which have $\ge 20$ answers to these questions used this pathway to arrive at these Tasks. Further, of these subjects, none were found to exhibit disk structure, although the clumps within were arranged in a spiral pattern. We therefore do not find this pathway necessary in examining responses to Tasks 03, 04, and 05.

In this section we have described how to use the previous Task thresholds in Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds} to select well-sampled galaxies which may or may not contain the feature associated with a unique Task. We will now offer two examples of how to use the vote fractions for the final Task to obtain a sample of galaxies with a certain morpholgical type, by creating a sample of bars and samples of clumpy galaxies grouped by clump mulitiplicity. 

\subsection{Example 1: Selecting bars} 

We created a sample of barred galaxies by applying cuts on the previous tasks as listed in Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds}. 11,049 ``bar candidates'', galaxies for which asking the bar question is meaningful, were selected by applying the cuts $N_{bar} \ge 20$, $p_{\rm features}>0.23, p_{\rm clumpy,no} > 0.30,$ and $p_{edgeon,no}>0.25$. These galaxies are featured, non-clumpy, non-edge~on galaxies. Of these, a pure sample of 730 barred disks was identified by applying a cut of $p_{bar}>0.7$. A subsample of 50 galaxies were visually inspected and 94\% were found to contain strong bars. A complete sample of strong and weak bars was created by applying a cut of $p_{bar}>0.3$. This sample contained 3,218 galaxies, 86\% of which were found to contain weak or strong bars through visual inspection in a subsample of 50.

GZH used both 5-epoch and 2-epoch sets of data to construct the GOODS set of images. The 11,157 full depth 5-epoch images are used in the main catalog; the classifications for the 7,464 shallow depth 2-epoch images are offered as a supplementary table. Here we briefly analyze the effect of image depth on the ability of the GZ users to identify features or disk structure in the images. 

\subsection{Comparing shallow and full depth morphologies}

Of the 11,157 galaxies in the GOODS-N and GOODS-S full depth sample, 4,461 of these are in the shallow-depth sample. In Figure~\ref{fig:shallow_vs_full} we find a strong correlation between $\rm p_{features}$ for both sets of images. The mean change in $\rm p_{features}$ from the shallow to full depth images  $\rm p_{features,full} - p_{features,shallow} \equiv \Delta p = 0.00$, with a standard deviation of $\sigma = 0.17$. While there is some variance in $\Delta p$ in the whole sample, the change is usually small and not often significant enough to change a morphological classification. Defining a clean sample of disk galaxies as those with $p_{features,best}>0.8$, elliptical galaxies as those with  $p_{smooth,best}<0.2$, and intermediate as those in between, we find that 75\% of the sample would not change morphology. Of the remaining 25\% that would change morphology, only 0.3\% (representing 10 galaxies total) drastically change morphology from smooth to featured or visa versa, while the rest would transition to or from the ``intermediate'' morphology. Details can be seen in Table~\ref{tbl:shallow_to_full_stats} and examples of images representing the 9 possible changes (or lack of) in morphology are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:shallow_smooth},\ref{fig:shallow_intermediate}, and \ref{fig:shallow_featured}.

Uncorrectable images had a non single-valued relationship (blue regions). NEI images had undetermined relationships due to a lack of data ($N<5$) in their corresponding z-$\mu$ bins (gray regions). Only 17\% (maximum) of FERENGI galaxies in the sample were considered ``correctable'', which is not sufficient to compute a $\zeta$ function applicable to the Hubble data.   \label{tbl:ferengi_bar_corrections}}
