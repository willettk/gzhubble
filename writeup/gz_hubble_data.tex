\begin{abstract}
We present the data release paper for the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble (GZH)
project.\footnote{This publication has been made possible by the participation
of more than 200,000~volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions
are individually acknowledged at
\url{http://authors.galaxyzoo.org/authors.html}.} This is the third phase in a
large effort to measure reliable, detailed morphologies of galaxies by using
crowdsourced visual classifications of color composite images. Images in GZH
were selected from various publicly-released \textit{Hubble Space Telescope}
Legacy programs using the Advanced Camera for Surveys, with filters that probe
the rest-frame optical emission from galaxies out to $z\sim1$.  The bulk of the
sample is selected to have $m_{I814W}<23.5$, but goes as faint as
$m_{I814W}<26.8$ for deep images combined over 5~epochs. The median redshift of
the combined samples is $\langle z\rangle=0.9\pm0.6$, with a tail extending out
to $z\simeq4$. The GZH morphological data include measurements of both bulge-
and disk-dominated galaxies, details on spiral disk structure that relate to
the Hubble type, bar identification, and numerous measurements of clump
identification and geometry.  This paper also describes a new method for
calibrating morphologies for galaxies of different luminosities and at
different redshifts by using artificially-redshifted galaxy images as a
baseline. The GZH catalog contains both raw and calibrated morphological vote
fractions for $119,849$~galaxies, providing the largest dataset to date
suitable for large-scale studies of galaxy evolution out to $z\sim1$.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The morphology of galaxies encodes information on the orbital parameters and
assembly history of their contents, including gas, dust, stars, and the central
black hole. The morphology is also closely related to the local environment of
the galaxy, as mutual interactions such as tides, shocks in cluster
environments, and direct mergers can all change the shape of the galaxy's
gravitational potential. For $M^\star$~galaxies in the local Universe, this
interplay between the physical development of a galaxy and its external
appearance typically manifests at the most basic level as the difference
between bulge-dominated systems with no/little spiral structure (early-types)
and disk-dominated, rotationally-supported galaxies (late-types) frequently
exhibiting spiral arms.  This dichotomy has been used to explore much of the
astrophysics governing galaxy formation and evolution, and has been shown to be
closely linked with other galactic properties such as stellar mass, halo mass,
bolometric luminosity, black hole activity, effective radius, and the relative
ages of the stellar populations.

The advent of larger telescopes in an increasing range of observing wavelengths
has revealed that the distribution and properties of galaxy morphology have
strongly evolved over the lifetime of the Universe. At redshift $z\simeq1$
(roughly 6~Gyr after the Big Bang), many galaxies are still in the process of
assembling the baryonic mass required to reproduce the mature, coherent
structures seen in the present day. This growth occurs in a variety of
pathways, including accretion of baryons from large-scale galactic filaments
onto halos via streaming, mergers of individual dark matter halos along with
their baryons, conversion of gas into stars through gravitational collapse and
star formation, etc. The process can also be slowed or even reversed via
feedback from stellar winds, supernovae, and active black holes.  Each of these
processes affects the galaxy morphology in different ways, and so an accurate
measurement of the demographics as a function of redshift provides an extremely
powerful observational constraint on the physics involved \citep[for recent
reviews see][]{but13,con14}. 

Theoretical predictions for the morphology of galaxies as a function of
redshift are primarily computed within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework.
Full treatments model gravitational interactions between baryons and dark
matter, hydrodynamics of the gas, and baryonic physics related to star
formation and evolution. The most advanced simulations now span volumes up to
$\sim100$~Mpc$^3$ while simultaneously resolving the smaller ($<1$ kpc) scales
necessary to reproduce the influence of baryonic physics \citep{vog14a,sch15}.
Such simulations predict clustering of galaxies on large scales in a
hierarchical assembly model \citep{sil12}. The structure of individual galaxies
is affected by their merger history \citep{too72,ste02,hop10,kav14,kav14a}, local
environment \citep[\eg, the morphology-density relation;][]{dre80}, initial
dark halo mass, secular evolution rate, and many other factors. Morphologies of
individual simulated high-mass galaxies at $z\sim2-3$ commonly show kpc-scale
``clumpy'' structures, with few galaxies that are either smooth or well-ordered
spirals; asymmetric galaxies with strong density contrasts dominate simulated
populations in the early Universe until at least $z\sim1$ \citep{bel12,gen14}. 

Observational studies of galaxies at high-redshift also display a wide range of
morphological types, many of which are rare or absent at $z\sim0$.  These
include spheroids and disks (akin to the ellipticals and spirals seen in the
local Universe), but also a significant population of massive, more irregular
galaxies, including mergers, tadpoles, chains, double-clumps, and
clump-clusters \citep{elm05,elm07,cam11a,for11a,kar15}.  In contrast, while
grand-design spirals have been observed as far back as $z=2.18$ \citep{law12},
their spatial density suggests that they are exceedingly rare at these high
redshifts, with a very low overall disk fraction \citep{mor13}. Current
observational data thus strongly suggests that the classical Hubble
sequence/tuning fork \citep{hub36} is not a suitable framework for
characterizing high-redshift morphology. 

Space-based observatories, particularly the \hubble{} (\hst), have been
responsible for the bulk of imaging studies of high-redshift galaxies.
Observations of fields with very deep imaging
\citep[eg,][]{wil96,gia04,bec06,dav07,sco07,gro11} give the photometric
sensitivity necessary to detect $L^\star$ galaxies at $z>1$, while also
providing the angular resolution to distinguish internal structure and
characterize the morphology. While these measurements are helped by the fact
that the angular diameter distance is relatively flat beyond $z>1$ in a flat
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the relevant angular scales are only of the order
$\sim5-10~\mathrm{kpc}/^{\prime\prime}$ \citep{wri06}. \hst{} can thus resolve
much of the structure for a Milky Way-sized galaxy out to moderately high
redshifts (at least distinguishing a disk from a bulge), but is limited for
more compact structures. Since the size of galaxies evolves as roughly
$r\propto(1+z)^{-1}$ \citep{mao98,law12a}, the compact sizes of high-redshift
galaxies make detailed morphologies a challenge even for \hst{} \citep{che12}.
However, the public availability of more than $10^5$~galaxies in archival
imaging has generated a data sample with the potential
for statistically-robust studies of galaxy demographics and evolution. 

One of the major difficulties in studying the morphologies of galaxies lies in
the techniques used for measurement. Visual classification by experts has been
used for many decades \citep[eg,][]{hub26,dev59,san61,van76,nai10,bai11,kar15}.
These methods have the advantage of using the significant processing power of
the human brain to identify patterns, but suffer from issues such as lack of
scaling to large surveys and potential issues with replicability and
calibration (e.g., see \citealt{lah95} for a discussion on the extent to which
eight expert classifiers agree with each other). Automated measurements, both
parametric \citep{pen02a,sim11,lac12} and non-parametric
\citep{abr03,con03,lot04,sca07,bam08,fre13}, scale well to very large sample
sizes, but do not always fully capture the relevant features, especially for
asymmetric galaxies that become increasingly common at high redshifts. The
Galaxy Zoo project \citep{lin08,for12} utilizes crowdsourced visual classifications
to measure galaxies in color-composite images. The efforts of more than
$2\times10^5$~classifiers allow for multiple independent classifications of
each image which are combined and calibrated to give a distribution of vote
fractions proportional to the probability of a feature being visible. While
crowdsourced data require extensive calibration \citep{bam09,wil13}, they have
a proven reliability and have been used for a wide variety of scientific
studies \citep[eg,][]{lan08,bam09,dar10,mas11c,ski12,sim13,sch14,wil15}. 

This paper presents the classifications collected from the Galaxy Zoo Hubble
(GZH) project.\footnote{\url{http://zoo3.galaxyzoo.org/}} GZH was the third
phase of Galaxy Zoo, following its initial results classifying
$\sim900,000$ Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)~images into primarily early/late~types \citep{lin11} and
Galaxy~Zoo~2, which covered a subset of $\sim250,000$~images using a more detailed
classification scheme that included bars, spiral arms, and galactic bulges
\citep{wil13}. GZH used a similarly detailed classification scheme, but focused
for the first time on images of high-redshift galaxies taken with \hst. The
Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS project has also classified morphologies of galaxies at
high redshift, but using ACS and WFC3 rest-frame infrared imaging (Simmons
et~al., submitted).

The sample selection and creation of the images used for GZH is described in
Section~\ref{sec:data}. Section~\ref{sec:interface} describes the GZH interface
and the collection of classifications. Section~\ref{sec:debiasing} outlines the
process used to calibrate and correct the crowdsourced vote fractions for
redshift-dependent bias. Section~\ref{sec:results} gives the main catalog of
results, with several examples of how the data may be queried in
Section~\ref{sec:cookbook}. Section~\ref{sec:analysis} gives a short overview
of the observed morphological demographics and compares them to several other
catalogs, with a summary in Section~\ref{sec:summary}.

This paper assumes the WMAP9 cosmological parameters of
$(\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda,h)=(0.286,0.714,0.693)$ \citep{hin13}.

\section{Sample and Data}\label{sec:data}

The GZH project contains images drawn from a number of different dedicated
surveys and sample selection criteria. The majority of the data (as implied by
the project name) were sourced directly from \hst{} Legacy Surveys, all of which
primarily used imaging from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). In addition
to \hst{} images, the project uses images from SDSS Stripe~82, as well as
simulated \hst{} images from multiple sources. Below we provide details on each
source of imaging and describe the creation process for images shown to classifiers. 
We also detail the sources of metadata for galaxies in the sample, such as 
photometry and redshifts.

\subsection{Hubble Legacy Surveys}\label{ssec:legacy_surveys}

Image information from
the individual surveys have been combined into a single photometric and
morphological database, the Advanced Camera for Surveys General Catalog
\citep[ACS-GC;][]{gri12}. A summary of the key parameters is given in
Table~\ref{tbl:gzh_numbers}. 


\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=160mm]{figures/filter_curves.pdf}
\caption{Transmission curves of the filters used by \hst{} Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS) in wide-field channel mode for the various surveys in GZH. The
unfilled black curves show the filters for the Suprime Camera on \subaru, which
was used to create color gradients in the GZH COSMOS
images.}
\label{fig:filtercurves}
\end{figure*}

The properties of the individual surveys are as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item The All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey
    \citep[AEGIS;][]{dav07} covers a strip centered at
    $\alpha=14^\textrm{h}17^\textrm{m}, \delta=+52^\circ30^\prime$. This area
    of the sky was selected for a deep survey due to a combination of low
    extinction and low Galactic/zodiacal emission. The ACS images covered 63
    separate tiles over a total area of $\sim710$~arcmin$^2$. The two ACS bands
    for AEGIS had exposure times of 2300~seconds in F606W (\Vband) and
    2100~seconds in F814W (\Iband). The final mosaic images were dithered
    to a resolution of 0.03~\arcsec/pixel. For extended objects, the
    limiting magnitude of sources was 26.23~(AB) in \Vband{} and 25.61 (AB) in
    \Iband. 

\item The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey \citep[GOODS;][]{gia04}
    covered two separate fields in the northern and southern hemispheres: the Hubble
    Deep Field-North ($\alpha=12^\textrm{h}36^\textrm{m},
    \delta=+62^\circ14^\prime$) and the Chandra Deep Field-South
    ($\alpha=03^\textrm{h}32^\textrm{m}, \delta=-27^\circ48^\prime$). The \hst{}
    ACS imaging data from the two fields are referred to as GOODS-N and GOODS-S,
    respectively. ACS imaging in GOODS fields used 4~filters -- F435W (\Bband),
    \Vband, F775W (\iband), and F850LP (\zband). The mean exposure times for each
    epoch varied by band, from 1050--2100~seconds. The \Bband{} images were completed
    in a single epoch at the beginning of the survey, but the \Vband, \iband, and
    \zband{} images were taken in five separate epochs separated by 40--50~days
    each. Images were dithered to a pixel scale of 0.03~\arcsec/pixel and covered a
    total area of $\sim320$~arcmin$^2$ (160~arcmin$^2$ per north/south field). The
    $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude for extended sources was 25.7 for \Vband{} and
    25.0 for \iband. 

\item The Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and SEDs
    \citep[GEMS;][]{rix04,cal08} survey was centered on the Chandra Deep
    Field-South. The GEMS data covered $\sim800$~arcmin$^2$, completely surrounding
    the area covered by GOODS-S. Images from ACS in GEMS had 1~orbit per pointing
    for a total of 63~pointings. The exposure times were 2160 and 2286~seconds in
    \Vband{} and \zband{}, respectively. The image resolution had a pixel scale
    of 0.03~\arcsec/pixel. The $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude for source
    detection was 25.7~AB in \Vband{} and 24.2~AB in \zband. 

\item The Cosmic Evolution Survey \citep[COSMOS;][]{sco07} covered an area of
    $\sim1.8$~deg$^2$ centered at $\alpha=10^\textrm{h}00^\textrm{m},
    \delta=+02^\circ12^\prime$. Its location near the celestial equator was
    designed to enable coverage by ground-based telescopes in both the Northern and
    Southern Hemispheres, in addition to space-based observatories. The ACS data
    for COSMOS consisted of 1~orbit per pointing with an exposure time of
    2028~seconds in \Iband; 590~total pointings were used to cover the entire
    field. The image resolution was dithered to 0.05~\arcsec/pixel. The 50\%
    completeness magnitude for a galaxy with a half-light radius of
    $0.50^{\prime\prime}$ in \Iband{} was 24.7~mag. 

\end{itemize}

%Selection of galaxies from these samples is described in Section \ref{ssec:galselect} below. 
In the ACS-GC \citep{gri12}, individual galaxies were identified using a
combination of \sextractor{} \citep{ber96} and the galaxy-profile fitting
framework \galapagos{} \citep{bar12}. GZH included all galaxies with $m<23.5$,
where $m$ is in the \Iband, \zband, or \iband{} for the AEGIS + COSMOS, GEMS +
GOODS-S (2-epoch), and GOODS-N (2-epoch) surveys, respectively. The full-depth
GOODS images from both fields included galaxies with $m<26.8$. This yielded a
total of $119,849$~images (Table~\ref{tbl:gzh_numbers}).

Images from \hst{} legacy surveys were used to create multiple different color
and grayscale images using different depths and filter combinations; these are
described further in Section \ref{ssec:images}. Additionally, the use of a
small set of \hst{} images to create simulated images of active galactic
nucleus (AGN) host galaxies is described in Section \ref{ssec:sim_agn}.

\end{table*}

\subsection{The Sloan Digital Sky Survey}\label{ssec:sdss}

The project includes images from the SDSS \citep{yor00,str02}, in particular
those from Data~Release~7 \citep{aba09}. A small number of images were used in
the creation of simulated \hst{} images, described in Sections
\ref{ssec:ferengi} and \ref{sec:debiasing} below; the majority of SDSS images
used in GZH were from Stripe~82. The Stripe~82 samples in GZH include
single-epoch and co-added images. The single-epoch images provide a local
sample for comparison to higher-redshift galaxies (including the new
measurements of clumpy structure), while the co-added images allow for analysis
of morphological properties as a function of image depth. 

%The creation of 51,861 images from these sources is described in Section
%\ref{ssec:galselect} below.
Single-epoch images from SDSS Stripe~82 were selected using the criteria
from \citet{wil13}, which required limits of \texttt{petroR90\_r}$ >
3$\arcsec~(where \texttt{petroR90\_r} is the radius containing 90\% of the
$r$-band Petrosian flux) and a magnitude brighter than $m_r < 17.77$.
21,522~galaxies in SDSS met these criteria.
Co-added images from Stripe~82 were selected from the union of galaxies with
co-added magnitudes brighter than $17.77$~mag, and the galaxies detected in the
\stripe{} images and matched to a co-add source. This resulted in a total
set of 30,339~images. Of the images in the co-added sample, 5144 (17~percent)
were dimmer than the initial magnitude cut of 17.77. 


\subsection{Simulated \hst{} images}\label{ssec:simulatedimages}

To facilitate correction of classifications in the presence of known redshift
bias (Section~\ref{sec:debiasing}), GZH includes two different samples of
simulated \hst{} images: real \hst{} galaxy images (Section
\ref{ssec:legacy_surveys}) with nuclear emission added to simulate AGN host
galaxies, and lower-redshift galaxy images from SDSS (Section \ref{ssec:sdss}),
artificially redshifted from $0.3 \leq z \leq 1$.  Each is described separately
below. 

\subsubsection{Images with simulated nuclear point sources}\label{ssec:sim_agn}

As active galactic nuclei often have bright, unresolved optical emission, AGN
have the potential to mimic or distort the identification of a bulge component.
GZH thus includes a set of images designed to measure the effect of AGN on
morphological classifications.  The presence of an AGN was simulated by
modeling the point spread function (PSF) of the telescope and then inserting a
bright source near the center of a real galaxy. For each image, the simulated
AGN was assigned one of three colors -- either blue, red, or flat (white) as
seen in the color images -- and a range of brightnesses such that
$L_\mathrm{ratio} \equiv L_\mathrm{galaxy}/L_\mathrm{AGN}$ is in
$(0.2,1.0,5.0,10.0,50.0)$. Combining these parameters generated 15~images
with different simulated AGN for each host, in addition to the original galaxy
image. 

Two sets of simulated AGN were generated in GZH. The first set (version~1) was
assembled from 95~galaxies from GOODS-S imaging and empirical PSFs made by
combining stars in the GOODS fields using the PSF creation tools in
\texttt{daophot}.  The second set (version~2) was assembled from 96~galaxies in
GOODS-S; this version used simulated PSFs from \texttt{TinyTim} \citep{kri93},
drizzled using the same procedures as those used in the reduction of the GOODS-S
images \citep{koe02,koe03,gia04}. The use of these two versions facilitates
comparisons between these different PSF creation methods, which are widely used
in AGN host galaxy morphology studies
\citep[e.g.,][]{san04,sim08,pie10a,simm11}.  Each PSF creation method has
advantages and disadvantages: the empirical PSFs better represent the nuances
of the PSF in the specific data being used and look more realistic at lower
luminosities, but the extended features of the noiseless \texttt{TinyTim} PSFs
are visually more realistic at higher luminosities.
% okay so I'm a cheeky self-citing biyotch - BDS

Images with simulated AGN were classified in the interface in an identical
manner and evenly distributed with unaltered images of the galaxies.
Volunteers were not explicitly told that the images had been altered during
classification, as the goal was to measure the effect on normal classifications
using the same technique as closely as possible. Following classification, a
classifier could view a page with additional details about each galaxy; where
applicable, these pages contained further information regarding image
modifications. \citet{sim13} uses the simulated AGN host galaxy images for
more reliable identification of bulgeless galaxies hosting AGN in SDSS data.


\subsubsection{Generating images of artificially-redshifted galaxies}\label{ssec:ferengi}

The dimming and resolution effects of redshift can significantly affect galaxy
classifications derived from any method. To facilitate corrections due to
redshift, we include a sample of 288~galaxies with SDSS imaging that can be
transformed to simulate \hst{} imaging out to $z = 1$. 
The SDSS images were redshifted and processed to mimic simulated \hst{} imaging 
parameters using the \ferengi{} code \citep{bar08a}.

%The selection criteria for the different morphological categories is
%summarized in Table \ref{tbl:morphologies}. 
 
%\input{tables/morphologies.tex}

In addition to the physical parameters of the input images, the \ferengi{}
output depends on assumptions of the global galaxy evolution model. This
evolution is a crude mechanism that mimics the brightness increase of galaxies
with increasing redshift \citep[\eg,][]{lil98,lov12}. The effect on the
redshifted images is simply an empirical addition to the magnitude of a galaxy
of the form $M' = e\times z + M$, where $M'$ is the corrected magnitude, and
$e$ is the evolutionary correction in magnitudes ($e=-1$ essentially
brightens the entire galaxy by 1~magnitude by $z=1$). \ferengi{} was run on the images
for values of $e$ starting from $e=0$ and decreasing to $e=-3.5$ in increments
of $\Delta e = 0.5$. Figure~\ref{fig:exampleFERENGI} shows several examples
of the effects of ``losing'' spiral/disk features with increasing redshift
for two galaxies with no evolution corrections ($e=0$); as the signal-to-noise ratio in the images
decreases and the galaxies become fainter, the contrast between features
like spiral arms goes down and \ffeatures{} drops to the point where both
galaxies would have been classified as likely ellipticals. 

The final number of \ferengi{} images produced for each galaxy is ultimately a
function of the galaxy's redshift (since the new images cannot be resampled at
better angular resolution than the original SDSS data), as well as the number
of $e$ values selected. The use of these images to correct for redshift-dependent
bias is described in Section \ref{sec:debiasing}.

\subsection{Creating color images}\label{ssec:images}

The images used for classification in GZH were color-composite JPEGs made from
multi-band data. These were created following the method of \citet{lup04}, which
preserves color information irrespective of intensity.  An asinh intensity
mapping was applied to enhance the appearance of faint features while avoiding
saturating galaxy centers. The relative scalings of the filter bands were
chosen while trying to reproduce the color appearance of the SDSS images in
previous iterations of Galaxy Zoo.

Many of the Legacy surveys described in Section~\ref{ssec:legacy_surveys}
provided \hst{} images in only two filters. For these, the shorter-wavelength band was
mapped to the blue channel, the longer-wavelength band to the red channel, and
the green channel created by taking the arithmetic mean of the two. The bands
used in each of the surveys are listed in Table~\ref{tbl:gzh_numbers}.
Although four bands were available for the GOODS survey, only two bands were
used to create the original 2-epoch images, for consistency with AEGIS and
GEMS. The 2-epoch GOODS-N and GOODS-S images were created using different
filters --- this was a deliberate choice made so that the GEMS images could be
directly compared with the overlapping coverage of GOODS-S
(Figure~\ref{fig:filtercurves}).

Only 2-epoch GOODS images were included at the launch of GZH.  Deeper, 5-epoch 
GOODS images were added into GZH later (in March 2015). These images made
use of the full four-band data by using the arithmetic mean of \Bband{} and
\Vband{} in the blue channel, \Iband{} in the green channel, and \zband{} in
the red channel.

The COSMOS survey provides only \Iband{} HST imaging. For these galaxies, GZH
used ``pseudocolor'' images created by using the ACS \Iband{} data as an
illumination map and ground-based imaging from the \subaru{} telescope in
$B_J$, $r^+$, and $i^+$ filters to provide color information (see
\citealt{gri12} for further details). This resulted in images with the angular
resolution of \hst{} ($\sim0.05$~\arcsec/pixel) for the overall intensity, but
color gradients at ground-based resolution, with seeing between 0.95\arcsec{}
and 1.05\arcsec{} \citep{tan07}.

Stripe~82 single-epoch images were taken directly from the DR7 SDSS SkyServer,
which combined $g^{\prime}$, $r^{\prime}$, and $i^{\prime}$ exposures into the
RGB channels \citep{nie04}. The co-added Stripe~82 images were assembled from runs 106 and
206 in DR7 and processed into color composites in the same manner as previous
iterations of Galaxy~Zoo.

In some cases, we found that attempting to emphasize faint features in the
images resulted in the sky noise taking the appearance of brightly colored
speckles. This impaired the aesthetics of the images and might have been a
distraction to visual classification.  To counteract this, a soft-edged object
mask was applied to the color images and a desaturation operation performed.
This masking procedure was effective in preserving the color balance for
galaxies and retained the visibility of faint features, while reducing the color
contrast in the sky noise and greatly improving the appearance of the images.
This solution was applied to the coadded Stripe~82, COSMOS and 5-epoch GOODS
images.

In addition to the primary \hst{} legacy imaging sample with colored images
described as above, GZH also includes samples of \hst{} galaxy images with
different color prescriptions. In particular, there are two sets of 3,927~images
each, drawn from the COSMOS sample; the first has a dramatically reduced color
saturation, and the second has reversed the colors so that the blue and red
filters have exchanged places in the RGB image. The `faded' galaxy set
facilitates measuring of possible variations in classification due to the
presence or absence of color features. The `recolored' set enables an
alternative test of potential color biases in classifications.
% I guess this means we need to say somewhere later that we don't see an effect
% (we don't, right?).  Would also be good to cite here where we have done
% similar things in the past... - BDS

The simulated AGN host galaxy color images (described in Section \ref{ssec:sim_agn})
were created using the same prescription as for the GOODS 2-epoch imaging. The
artificially redshifted color images (Section \ref{ssec:ferengi}) were created using the
same prescription as for the AEGIS images.
% Edmond should verify the AEGIS bit above. - BDS


\subsection{Galaxy sample labels}\label{ssec:sample_labels}

The full GZH sample is composed of 8~different galaxy sub-samples. Throughout
this paper and in the published catalogs they are referred to with the
following labels:

\begin{itemize}

%\ref{tbl:catalog_hst}
\item \main: \hst{} imaging with RGB colors making use of all available
filters with typical saturation and in correct order, as described in
Section~\ref{ssec:images}. This sample includes AEGIS, COSMOS, GEMS, and
full-depth GOODS (North and South) images. (113,705~galaxies)

%\ref{tbl:catalog_faded}
\item \faded: a subset of COSMOS images with very low color saturation.
(3,927~galaxies)

%\ref{tbl:catalog_recolored}
\item \recolored: a subset of COSMOS images with red and blue channels
reversed. Note: this sub-sample uses the same galaxies as the \texttt{faded}
sub-sample. (3,927~galaxies)

%\ref{tbl:catalog_goods_shallow}
\item \goods: Images from GOODS-North and GOODS-South, with
color from 2~filters and imaged at 2-epoch depth. (6,144~galaxies)

%\ref{tbl:stripe82_single}
\item \stripe: Single-epoch images from SDSS Stripe~82.
(21,522~galaxies)

%\ref{tbl:stripe82_coadd}
\item \coadd: Co-added images from SDSS Stripe~82. Note: this
sub-sample includes all galaxies in the \texttt{stripe-82-single} sub-sample,
with additional sources detected in the deeper imaging. (30,339~galaxies)

%ferengi <-- no table?
\item \redshifted: Simulated \hst{} images constructed using SDSS
images and artificially processed to redshifts between $0.3 \leq z \leq 1$.
(288~original galaxies; 6,624~redshifted images)

%\ref{tbl:simulated_agn}
\item \simagn: Simulated AGN host galaxies constructed using \hst{} images and
PSFs. (96~original galaxies; 2,961~images of simulated AGN hosts)


\end{itemize}


\subsection{Galaxy metadata}

Photometric data for the bulk of the GZH \main, \faded, \recolored, and
\goods{} samples were largely drawn from the tables in \citet{gri12}. This
included photometric parameters such as the fluxes, magnitudes, radii,
ellipticities, position angles, and positions drawn from both \sextractor{} and
\galfit.  All photometric parameters were measured in both bands of the ACS
imaging, with the exception of the single-band COSMOS images. Photometric data
for the GOODS 5-epoch imaging, including \sextractor{} parameters, is from
\citet{gia12}.
%\galfit{} also provided the parametric \sersic{} index and effective
%half-light radius for the best-fit model. 


Redshifts for the GZH catalog were compiled from a variety of sources. For each
galaxy, the primary redshift is in the $\tt Z\_BEST$ column of
Table~\ref{tbl:catalog_hst}. The redshift type (spectroscopic: $\tt SPEC\_Z$,
photometric: $\tt PHOTO\_Z$, or grism: $ \tt GRISM\_Z$) is listed in the column
$\tt Z\_BEST\_TYPE$, and the source catalog of the redshift is included as $\tt
Z\_BEST\_SOURCE$. 

For galaxies which have published redshifts from multiple sources, the
following algorithm was used to select the $\tt Z\_BEST$ quantity. A
high-quality spectroscopic redshift in the ACS-GC is the primary option,
provided in the ACS-GC \citep{gri12}, 3DHST \citep{mom15}, and MUSYC
\citep{car10} catalogs and used in that order. For galaxies with multiple
spectroscopic redshifts, more than 98\% are consistent ($\Delta z<0.001$), and
so the order of selection made no practical difference. Galaxies with
inconsistent spectroscopic redshifts between any pair of catalogs are marked
with a flag in Table~\ref{tbl:catalog_hst}. If no spectroscopic redshifts were
available, the 1-$\sigma$ errors of the photometric \citep[ACS-GC, 3DHST,
MUSYC, UltraVISTA;][]{ilb13} and UltraVISTA grism data were used to select the
estimated redshift with the smallest error. 
%Table~\ref{tbl:redshifts} shows the results of this selection. 
 
%\begin{figure*}
%\center
%\includegraphics[width=160mm]{figures/specz_comparison.pdf}
%\caption{Spectroscopic redshifts from the ACS-GC, 3DHST, and MUSYC catalogs.
%The number in the upper left of each plot is the percentage of redshifts which
%agree within $\Delta z < 0.05$ between the two catalogs being compared in each
%panel. Within this range there is over 98\% agreement in redshifts between all
%three catalogs.}
%\label{fig:speczs}
%\end{figure*}

%\input{tables/redshifts.tex}

Photometric and spectroscopic data for the \stripe{} and \coadd{} galaxies were taken
from the CasJobs DR7 tables. This included $ugriz$ Petrosian magnitudes and
fluxes, as well as the relative de~Vaucouleurs and exponential fits from the
model magnitudes. All redshifts used for SDSS galaxies were spectroscopic.
82.6\% of galaxies in the \stripe{} images and 65.1\% of galaxies in the
\coadd{} images had a measured DR7 spectroscopic redshift. 

The technique for redshift debiasing (Section~\ref{sec:debiasing}) requires
consistent measurements of the galaxy surface brightness. For both the
\redshifted{} calibration images and the \hst{} images which have their
morphologies corrected, we calculate the mean surface brightness $\mu$ within the
effective radius ($R_e$) as:

\begin{equation}
\mu = m + 2.5*\log_{10}{(2 \times (b/a) \times \pi R_e^2 )}.
\label{eqn:surface_brightness}
\end{equation}

All photometric parameters are taken from \sextractor. For the \ferengi{}
galaxies, $m$ is {\tt MAG\_AUTO} in the \Iband{} band, $(b/a)$ is the galaxy
ellipticity (the profile RMS along the semi-major and -minor axes), and $R_e$
is the 50\% {\tt FLUX\_RADIUS} converted into arcsec \citep{mel16}. For the \hst{} galaxies in the \main{} sample,
the parameters are identical except that we use {\tt MAG\_BEST} instead of
{\tt MAG\_AUTO} \citep{gri12} in either the \Iband, \iband, or \zband{} bands, depending 
on the available imaging (Table~\ref{tbl:gzh_numbers}).


\section{GZH interface and classifications}\label{sec:interface}

Below we describe the classification structure of GZH, including the software 
interface and the hierarchical structure of a classification. Section \ref{ssec:weighting}
describes the process of combining individual classifications into vote fractions for each
galaxy.

\subsection{Interface and decision tree}\label{ssec:interface}

\begin{figure*}
\center
\includegraphics[width=160mm]{figures/gzh_interface.png}
\caption{Screenshot of the GZH interface at
the beginning of classifying a random galaxy, with the classifier ready
to select an answer for the first question in the decision
tree.\label{fig:interface}}
\end{figure*}

Classifications for GZH were made using a web-based interface
(Figure~\ref{fig:interface}), similar in design to Galaxy~Zoo and Galaxy~Zoo~2.
The front-end runs on a Ruby~on~Rails framework with classifications stored in
a MySQL backend. Classifiers were shown a randomly-selected color composite image from
the GZH sample; the default showed the image with a black sky background,
although they had the option to invert the color palette if desired. The
questions and responses for morphology appeared on the right side of the image as
a panel, including both text and icons. There was no tutorial required for
participation, although classifiers could access an extensive ``Help'' section
containing example images and descriptive text for all the morphological
labels. 

\begin{figure*}
\center
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/gzh_decision_tree.pdf}
\caption{Flowchart of the questions presented to GZH classifiers, labeled with
the corresponding task numbers. Tasks in the decision tree are color-coded by
tier level: Gray-colored tasks are 1$^\mathrm{st}$-tier questions which are
asked in every classification. Tasks colored green, blue, purple, and pink
(respectively) are one, two, three, or four steps below branching points in the
decision tree. The dashed line between T15 and T03 indicates the unique case
where volunteers could label both clumpy and disk-like morphologies for
galaxies with clumps arranged in a spiral pattern.}
\label{fig:decisiontree}
\end{figure*}

The procedure for classifying an image in GZH followed a hierarchical decision
tree (Figure~\ref{fig:decisiontree}). Every classification began with the step of
identifying whether the object at the center of the image was a smooth galaxy,
a galaxy with a disk or other features, or a star/artifact. Subsequent
questions in the tree depended on the previous answer(s) given by the classifier; the
decision tree was designed so that every question relevant to
the morphology in the process of being identified was answered. Questions that were not
answered were implicitly assumed to be absent in the image --- for example, if
the classifier identified a galaxy as being smooth, they were not asked to count the
number of spiral arms. For every task, the classifier chose a single answer before
continuing to the next question; they also had the option to restart any
classification in-progress. 

The GZH decision tree was designed to remain close to that used by GZ2 while
taking account of the likely differences in high redshift systems, and has four
broad sets of morphologies classified by the users.  The first set
identified stars or image artifacts (the result of either bad data or incorrect
identification as a galaxy by the ACS pipeline); in this case, the
classification process ended and no further questions were asked. The second
set was smooth galaxies, intended to select ellipticals/early-types;
volunteers also indicate the relative axial ratio (roundness) for these
galaxies. The third set was for disk/late-type galaxies, which labeled the
features necessary to place a galaxy on the standard Hubble tuning fork (bars,
spiral arm, strength of the central bulge). The final set, which was new in
this phase of Galaxy~Zoo and designed for high-redshift targets, identified
objects dominated by clumpy morphologies. Further annotations for clumpy
galaxies included assessing the number, arrangement, relative brightness, and
location of the clumps within the galaxy. Finally, every classification of a
galaxy gave the option of identifying ``odd'' features within the image; these
labels were for relatively rare $(\lesssim1\%)$ phenomena, including dust
lanes, gravitational lenses, and mergers. 

The number of independent classifications per subject collected by GZH was on
average higher than GZ1 or GZ2, due to both the increased complexity of the
decision tree and the relative difficulty of classifying images of small and
distant galaxies. Images from the \main{} AEGIS, GEMS, and GOODS data sets had
a median of 122~independent classifications per image. The remainder of the
images either had a later activation date (\main{} COSMOS, \simagn) or a lower
retirement limit (\stripe{} and \coadd). Images from these samples had a median
of 46--48~classifications per image (Figure~\ref{fig:classification_hist}).

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/classification_hist.pdf}
\caption{Distribution of the total number of classifications per image for GZH,
split by survey.}
\label{fig:classification_hist}
\end{figure}

The GZH project was launched on 23~Apr~2010 with the inclusion of the AEGIS,
GEMS, GOODS 2-epoch, and SDSS Stripe~82 images. Images from COSMOS and the
simulated AGN were activated in Dec 2010, as well as a small sample of images
from AEGIS, GEMS, and GOODS that were previously excluded from the original
sample due to cuts on blended and/or saturated objects and subsequently
confirmed as classifiable galaxies. The GZH site collected data until its
replacement, the fourth phase of
Galaxy~Zoo\footnote{\url{http://zoo4.galaxyzoo.org}} (including data from both
the \hst{} CANDELS survey and SDSS DR8) began on 10~Sep~2012. Classifications
for the GOODS 5-epoch images were separately obtained from Mar-Jun 2015 using
the fourth version of the Galaxy~Zoo site and the same GZH decision tree.
The GZH project had a total of 10,349,357~classifications from
93,898~registered participants. 
% Sum is the total of the GZH SQL table plus the GOODS full-depth imaging in GZ4.


\subsection{Classifier weighting}\label{ssec:weighting}

As a first step to producing a consensus measurement of each galaxy, the votes
of individual volunteers who classified galaxies in GZH were combined to make a
vote fraction for each response ($f_{response}$) to a question in the decision
tree. Votes were subsequently weighted and re-combined in an iterative method
similar to that in previous versions of Galaxy~Zoo \citep{lan08,wil13}, using a
method chosen to be as egalitarian as possible while also identifying and
downweighting classifiers who frequently disagreed with others. The weighting
factor $w$ was 1 for the top 95\% of classifiers, as ranked by consistency.
For the bottom 5\% of classifiers, $w$ was designed to drop smoothly and was
effectively zero for the bottom 1\% in the distribution function. Since
downweighting only occurs for the bottom few percent of classifiers (and an even smaller
percentage of the classifications), the overall effect on the GZH dataset was
minimal. The method was effective, however, at filtering out contributions from
randomly classifying or malicious participants.

Classifications were aggregated and weighted only if the classifier was logged
into GZH under their username (which was encouraged, but not required for
participation). Classifications by participants who were not logged in were marked as
``Anonymous'' and receive the same $w=1$ weighting as the vast majority
of logged-in classifiers.
% We should also try to estimate how many anonymous classifiers there were, if possible. 
% Not clear that I can do that given the SQL data


\section{Correcting for redshift-dependent classification bias}\label{sec:debiasing}

The previous versions of Galaxy Zoo morphology classifications
\citep{lin11,wil13} were based on observations of galaxies in the SDSS,
which have a median redshift of $z<0.2$. In these cases, it
was assumed that there was no cosmological evolution of the morphologies of
galaxies and therefore any observed changes in the morphological distribution
were due to a redshift-dependent bias that affects image quality and
classification accuracy (\ie, galaxies of a given mass/size will appear smaller
and dimmer at higher redshifts).  This bias is not unique to the crowdsourcing
technique; its dependence in data quality is a potential problem for
\emph{both} automated and visual classifications, and must be addressed in
order to accurately measure demographics over any significant redshift range. 

For both previous releases of Galaxy~Zoo morphologies, a correction for
redshift-dependent bias was applied based on matching the mean classification
fractions at the highest redshifts with those at the lowest redshift.
\citet{bam09} and \citet{wil13} provide complete descriptions of the process
for GZ1 and GZ2, respectively.

In GZH, the redshift range is large enough that cosmological evolution of the
types and morphologies of galaxies is expected for the \hst{} sample. In
addition, the effects of band shifting will change the images even more across
these redshift ranges. As a result, the previous methods of correcting for
redshift-dependent bias do not work.  

In order to test and correct for the effects of redshift, GZH includes a set of
calibration images.  These are simulated images of a set of nearby galaxies as
they would appear observed at a variety of redshifts.  The input images are
from the SDSS \citep{yor00,str02}.  The sample consists of 288~well-resolved galaxies
at $z<0.013$. The galaxies spanned a variety of morphologies (as selected by
GZ2 classifications, including identifications of spiral structure,
ellipticals, mergers, edge-on disks, bulge prominence/shape, and bars) and
$r$-band surface brightnesses.  The overall selection spanned the
redshift range of SDSS targets and maximized the number of \hst{} galaxies at
the same surface brightness and redshift (Figure~\ref{fig:sb_redshift}).  The
\ferengi{} code was used to produce sets of images corresponding to
observations of these galaxies out to $z_\mathrm{sim}=1.0$ (see
Section~\ref{ssec:ferengi}).  The resulting images were classified in the GZH
interface using the standard classification scheme.


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}

and $z_{\rm sim}$. White contours show counts for the galaxies in the \main{}
sample, with the outermost contour starting at $N=1500$ and separated by
intervals of 1500.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Correcting morphologies for classification bias}\label{ssec:zeta}

The approach used in GZH for correcting the weighted classifications for
redshift bias rests on the assumption that the \emph{degree} of bias is a
function of the apparent size and brightness of the galaxy.
This is controlled by two types of parameters: \textbf{intrinsic} properties of
the galaxy itself, such as its physical diameter and luminosity, and
\textbf{extrinsic} properties, such as the distance (redshift) of the galaxy
and its relative orientation. The combination of all
such parameters forms a high-dimensional space, and it is not clear how to
separate this into individual effects. Instead, the method used here employs
only two parameters as a simple model of the effect of redshift brightness on classification: the
surface brightness ($\mu$; intrinsic) and redshift ($z$;
extrinsic).

We model the debiased vote fraction $f_{\mu,z}$ for an
artificially-redshifted galaxy as:

\begin{equation}
f_{\mu,z} = \left(f_{\mu,z=0.3}\right) \times e^{{\frac{z-z_0}{\zeta}}},
\label{eqn:fzeta}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $f_{\mu,z=0.3}$ is the vote fraction at the lowest redshift in
the artificially-redshifted sample ($z_0=0.3$). Here, $\zeta$ is a parameter that
controls the rate at which \ffeatures{} decreases with increasing redshift (and
that may depend on other galaxy properties). This function bounds the observed
vote fractions between $f_{\mu,z=0.3}$ and zero based on two assumptions: 1)
the vote fractions for featured galaxies decrease monotonically with increasing
redshift, therefore restricting vote fractions for a given galaxy to be less
than $f_{\mu,z=0.3}$ (which is almost always true of the data), and 2) the
vote fractions cannot be less than zero (which is always true).

\begin{figure*}
\center
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/zeta_examples_sorted.pdf}
\caption{Behavior of the normalized, weighted vote fractions of features
visible in a galaxy ($f_\textrm{features}$) as a function of redshift in the
artificial \ferengi{} images. Galaxies in this plot were randomly selected from
a distribution with $e=0$ and at least three detectable images in redshift bins
of $z\ge0.3$, and are sorted by \ffeaturesrest. Measured vote fractions (blue
solid line) are fit with an exponential function (red dashed line;
Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta}); the best-fit parameter for $\zeta$ is given above
each plot.}
% Error bars are binomial for each f, symmetrised, then added in quadrature.
\label{fig:zeta_examples}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:zeta_examples} shows the change in vote fraction and the
best-fit model for a random set of galaxies in the \ferengi{} sample. The
results show that there is a clear dependence on redshift for the observed
changes in \ffeatures. To examine whether a better fit should involve
additional parameters, we examine the global dependence of $\zeta$ on the
galaxy surface brightness. This is motivated by the fact that brighter galaxies
would presumably be easier to identify; \citet{bam09} and \citet{wil13} found
changes in \ffeatures{} depend on a combination of physical size and
absolute magnitude. To simplify our model, we subsume these into a single
parameter $\mu$.

Figure~\ref{fig:zeta_mu} examines the results of fitting the \ferengi{} images
with Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta}. This fit only includes galaxies where
\sextractor{} robustly measured the photometry in all images between
$0.3<z_\mathrm{sim}<1.0$ (such that $\sigma_{M_I}<1.0$~mag; \citealt{mel16}). Interestingly, the
derived correction is only a very weak function of surface brightness.
Higher-surface brightness galaxies have on average slightly stronger
corrections, possibly because these galaxies have larger $f_\textrm{features}$
values at high redshifts. Low surface brightness galaxies are more likely to
begin low and remain low; the bounded nature of the dropoff (and variance among
the individual voters) means that the average magnitude of $\zeta$ will be
lower. 

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/zeta_mu.pdf}
\caption{All fits for the \ferengi{} galaxies of the vote fraction dropoff
parameter $\zeta$ for \ffeatures{} as a function of surface brightness. This
includes only galaxies with a bounded range on the dropoff
($-10<\log(\zeta)<10$) and sufficient points to fit each function (37~original
galaxies, each artificially redshifted in eight bins over a range from $0.3\lesssim z_\mathrm{sim}\lesssim1.0$).}
\label{fig:zeta_mu}
\end{figure}

Since there is little evidence for any strong systematic dependence of $\zeta$
on $\mu$, we do not include any additional parameters in fitting to our
calibration model.  We fit the data in Figure~\ref{fig:zeta_mu} with a linear
function:

\begin{equation}
\log_{10}(\hat\zeta) = \zeta_0 + (\zeta_1 \times \mu),
\label{eqn:zetafit}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\hat\zeta$ is the correction factor applied to each galaxy as
a function of surface brightness. The best-fit parameters to the linear fit
(from least-squares optimization) are $\zeta_0=0.50$, $\zeta_1=-0.03$. To make the
final debiased correction, the simple exponential form of
Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta} is modified to bound the debiased vote fractions
between $f$ and 1:

\begin{equation}
f_\textrm{features,debiased} = 1 - (1 - f_\mathrm{features,weighted})e^{\frac{z-z_0}{\hat\zeta}}
\label{eqn:fzeta_mod}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $f_\mathrm{features,weighted}$ is the weighted vote fraction
described in Section~\ref{ssec:weighting}.

Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f} shows the change in \ffeatures{} as a function of their
lowest simulated redshift for the 3,449~\ferengi{} images with robust photometric
measurements across the full range of redshifts.  For each simulated redshift
value \zsim{} at a fixed surface brightness, \ffeaturesz{} is the value
measured at that simulated redshift. We plot \ffeaturesz{} against \ffeaturesrest, the
value measured for the same galaxy at \zsim$=0.3$. 
 
The objective is to use these data to predict, for a galaxy with a measured
\ffeaturesz{} value, what its \ffeatures{} value \emph{would have been} if it
had been viewed at $z=0.3$. This predicted value is defined as the ``debiased''
vote fraction \ffeaturesdebiased, and is calculated by applying a correction to
the measured value of \ffeatures, determined by the $\zeta$ function described
in the previous section. A reliable predicted value can be obtained so long as
the relationship between \ffeaturesz{} and \ffeaturesrest{} is single-valued;
that is, for a given \ffeaturesz, there is exactly one corresponding value of
\ffeatures{} at $z=0.3$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f} shows that the relationship between \ffeaturesz{} and
\ffeaturesrest{} is \emph{not} always single-valued; hence, it is not
appropriate to correct galaxies that lie in certain regions of surface
brightness/redshift/\ffeatures{} space. These regions tend to have low
\ffeatures{} values at high redshift, but a wide range of values at $z=0.3$.
These regions contain two morphological types of galaxies: the first set are
genuine ellipticals, which have low values of \ffeatures{} at both high and low
redshift. The second group are disks whose features become indistinct at high
redshift; hence their \ffeatures{} value at $z=0.3$ may be quite high, while
the value observed at high redshift is very low. This effect is strongest at
high $z$ and low $\mu$, where features become nearly impossible to discern in
the images (see top right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f}).

The criteria for determining whether a region of this space is single-valued,
and therefore correctable, is as follows: In each surface brightness and
redshift bin, the relationship between \ffeaturesz{} and \ffeaturesrest{} is
modeled by fitting the data with polynomials of degrees $n=3$, 2, and 1, and
using the best formal fit out of the three as measured by the sum of the
residuals. These fits are shown as the dashed black lines in
Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f}. Flat regions of the bins are areas in which there is
not a clear single-valued relationship between \ffeaturesz{} and
\ffeaturesrest. We quantify this by measuring the slope of the best-fit
polynomial; regions of the bins with a slope less than 0.4 are considered
\emph{not} one-to-one, and therefore \ffeaturesz{} cannot be boosted to its
\ffeaturesrest{} value.  Galaxies in this region are referred to as the
\emph{lower limit} sample, because the most stringent correction available is
that the weighted \ffeatures{} is a lower limit to the true value.  These
regions are highlighted in blue in Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f}. Uncolored (white)
regions of the plot have sufficiently high slopes to consider the relationship
as single-valued; galaxies in these regions are considered ``correctable'', and
only these are used in measuring the parameters for the $\zeta$ function
(Section~\ref{ssec:zeta}). Only surface brightness/redshift bins with at least
5~galaxies were considered; regions with fewer than 5~galaxies are considered
to have ``not enough information'' to determine the \ffeaturesz{} and
\ffeaturesrest{} relationship, colored gray in Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f}. These
galaxies are hereafter referred to as the ``NEI'' sample.

The unshaded regions in Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f} define discrete ranges of redshift,
surface brightness, and \ffeatures{} a galaxy must have in order for the
debiased correction to be confidently applied to a galaxy in the GZH sample.
While the appropriate correctable regions were defined discretely, the true
correctable region is assumed to be a smooth function of $z$, $\mu$, and
\ffeatures{}. To define this smooth space, we calculate the shape of the convex
hull that encloses the correctable and lower-limit \ferengi{} galaxies in
$z$-$\mu$-\ffeatures{} space. The boundaries are then adjusted until the
contamination from both groups is minimized. The resulting hulls define the
correctable and lower-limit regions for categorizing the \hst{} galaxies. The
results of this method and final categorization of the \hst{} sample are in
Table~\ref{tbl:hubble_debiasable}. Of the galaxies at redshift higher than
$z=0.3$, 17\% can be debiased using the $\zeta$ method, 27\% cannot be debiased
since the relationship between \ffeaturesz{} and \ffeaturesrest{} is not
monotonic, and 56\% cannot be debiased since they either have an unknown
redshift or insufficient numbers of \ferengi{} images in their $z$-$\mu$ value
to determine a reliable value of $\zeta$.

For the ``lower-limit'' galaxies for which a single debiased \ffeatures{} value
cannot be confidently assigned, the \emph{range} of debiased values is
estimated using a method visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f_zoom}. This uses the
\ferengi{} simulated data to analyze the range of intrinsic \ffeaturesrest{}
values for any given observed \ffeatures{} value, again as a function of
surface brightness and redshift. In each unclassifiable (shaded blue) $z$,$\mu$ bin, the spread of
intrinsic values of \ffeaturesrest{} for four ranges of observed \ffeatures{} is computed.
The range of intrinsic values is defined as the inner 80\% of the data,
represented by the orange bars in Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f_zoom}. For any galaxy which
cannot be directly debiased by the $\zeta$ method, these ranges are used to
denote the upper and lower limits on the expected values \ffeaturesrest{} as a
function of the observed \ffeatures.

Few galaxies in the sample have sufficiently high corrections to completely
change them from being confidently ``smooth'' to ``featured'' following the
correction for redshift bias (Figure~\ref{fig:debiased_corrections}). As a
check, we compare morphologies of highly boosted galaxies to the expert visual
classifications in CANDELS \citep{kar15}.  Only nine galaxies that
were strongly boosted (\ffeatures$<0.25$ and \fbest$>0.50$) in GZH also
appear in the CANDELS expert sample. Of those, \citet{kar15}
classify 4 as spheroids/disky, 2 as disks, 1 as a spheroid, 1 as
irregular/disky and 1 as unclassifiable. The \fbest{} values for GZH are all
between 0.5 and 0.7, making them all intermediate disk candidates. Visual
inspection of the GZH images shows extended disk structure in at least
5~images; the remaining 4 are either extremely faint or have imaging artifacts
in the ACS data.  Since the surveys use different rest-frame filters and the
overlap sample is tiny, though, detailed comparisons between the overall
morphologies are highly difficult.

\subsection{Challenges of debiasing questions beyond ``smooth or features''}\label{ssec:higher_order_tasks}

As with the HST images, each \ferengi{} subject had a varying number of
classifiers answering the various questions in the hierarchical decision tree.
Every classifier answers the first question, {\it ``Is the galaxy smooth and
rounded, with no sign of a disk?''}; as such, the vote fractions \fsmooth,
\ffeatures, and \fartifact{} all have the lowest statistical error for any
question in the tree, based only on the total number of responses (between
40 and 120; see Section~\ref{sec:interface}).  The number of participants
answering subsequent questions, however, is always equal to or less than the
number who answered the preceding question. The average number of responses per
task for fourth- or fifth-tier questions (such as spiral arm structure; Tasks
12--14) is only $4\pm4$ for the \ferengi{} sample. While this distribution is
strongly bimodal (reflecting the true morphologies of selected galaxies), the
very low absolute numbers of votes introduce very high variance when attempting
to calculate a statistical correction.

In the \ferengi{} data, these numbers severely limit the amount of information
that can be extracted for the higher-tier questions. The debiasing technique
used (Section~\ref{ssec:zeta}) requires that at least 10~classifiers answer each
question for a galaxy with $z_\mathrm{sim}=0.3$ \emph{and} the corresponding
image at higher redshift. This requirement is (by default) met by all galaxies
for the smooth/features question. However, this is often \emph{not} met for
questions beyond Task~01. On average, $60\%\pm24\%$ of the galaxies do not have
sufficient data to measure a correction, as compared to 2.0\% achieved for
Task~01 (Table~\ref{tbl:ferengi_corrections}). Of the remaining
\ferengi{} galaxies which did meet this requirement, polynomials were fit to
the data in each redshift-surface brightness bin, as was done for Task~01. The
goodness-of-fit was evaluated in each bin, for each Task, using a normalized
$\chi^2$ metric. The mean $\chi^2$ for all higher-order tasks was
$0.10\pm0.04$, significantly larger than the Task~01 value of $0.04$. Based on
this statistic, the data cannot not be modeled with sufficient confidence for
the higher order tasks. An example of the debiasing technique applied to
\fbar{} is shown in Section~\ref{sec:ferengi_bar}; visual inspection of
Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_fbar} confirms that the points in each bin are scattered
to a degree at which no strong correlation is present.  For these reasons,
debiased vote fractions are only offered in the GZH catalog for Task~01
(smooth/features).

\section{The Galaxy Zoo: Hubble catalog}\label{sec:results}

The catalog for GZH includes morphological data for 189,149~images
(generated from a total of 145,741~unique galaxies). The full table can be
accessed at \url{http://data.galaxyzoo.org}. The online data also includes a
secondary metadata table, which is drawn from a variety of sources detailed in
Section \ref{sec:data}. 
% 113705+6144+30339-4447 = 145,741
% main + goods_shallow + stripe82_coadd - goods_union

Each image is listed under a unique project ID (eg,~AHZ000001); the actual
galaxy in the image is identified by the combination of the OBJNO and original
survey. For each of the 55~responses in the GZH decision tree, the following
classification data is provided: for each question, $\tt N_{votes}$ is the
number of classifiers who answered that question. For each unique answer, $\tt fraction$
is the fraction of classifiers who selected that answer ($\rm N_{answer}/N_{votes}$), and
$\tt weighted$ is the weighted fraction, which takes into account overall
consistency (Section~\ref{ssec:weighting}). 

The GZH vote fractions can be largely dependent on the resolution of the image.
Two otherwise morphologically identical galaxies which differ significantly in
redshift, brightness, or size may result in very different vote fractions for
any given question, given that many features of a galaxy are difficult to
discern in less-resolved images (bars, spiral arms, disk structure, etc). For
this reason, caution must be used when taking vote fractions as cut-offs to
determine morphological structure; guidelines for careful classification are
given in Section~\ref{sec:cookbook}. 

The GZH catalog is corrected for redshift bias only for the first
question of the GZH decision tree (Section~\ref{sec:debiasing}), which asks
{\it ``Is the galaxy smooth and round, with no sign of a disk?''} For this
question, the catalog provides the additional parameters $\tt debiased$, $\tt
lower~limit$, $\tt upper~limit$, and $\tt best$ vote fractions. The $\tt best$
fraction for \ffeatures{} is chosen based on the categorization of the galaxy:
if it is ``correctable'', $\tt best = debiased$; if it is a lower limit, $\tt
best = lower~limit$; if neither condition applies, then $\tt best = weighted$.

The debiased and best vote fractions for \fsmooth{} are calculated on the
criteria that vote fractions for all answers must sum to unity:

\begin{equation}
f_\mathrm{smooth} \equiv 1 - f_\mathrm{features,best} - f_\mathrm{artifact}.
\label{eqn:constraint}
\end{equation}

\noindent In rare cases ($1.2\%$ of the \main{} sample), this requirement resulted in
negative vote fractions for \fsmooth; these were cases in which the
\ffeatures{} vote fraction was boosted to a high value relative to \fartifact.
In these cases, the constraint of Equation~\ref{eqn:constraint} is met by
setting \fsmooth$=0.0$ and decreasing \fbest{} accordingly. This correction is
typically small, with a median change of
\ffeatures{} or \fsmooth{} of $\Delta f = 0.04$.

Tables~\ref{tbl:catalog_hst}-\ref{tbl:simulated_agn} also contain flags for
Task 01 that identify clean (but not complete) samples of galaxies with high
likelihoods of being either smooth, featured, or a star/artifact.  These are
set as $\tt smooth/featured/artifact\_flag=1$ if $\rm
f_{smooth/features/artifact\_best}>0.8$. For a galaxy to be flagged as
``smooth'', an additional criterion of $\tt correction\_type =~$0, 1, or 2 is
applied. This accounts for the uncertainty in distinguishing between genuine
ellipticals and disks whose features have been washed out due to surface
brightness and redshift effects (Section~\ref{sec:debiasing}).

Data products for GZH are split by the type of image being classified. Each
sample in Section~\ref{ssec:sample_labels} corresponds to the data in
Tables~\ref{tbl:catalog_hst}-\ref{tbl:simulated_agn}.

\section{Using the catalog}\label{sec:cookbook}

The primary purpose of the GZH catalog is to provide a reliable method of
selecting galaxies of a desired morphological type.  This section provides
instructions for creating such pure samples using the vote fractions
corresponding to the tasks shown in Figure~\ref{fig:decisiontree}
\citep[eg,][]{mas11c,che15,gal15}. Increasing the levels of the thresholds can
create purer, but not necessarily complete, morphologically-selected samples.
These are useful for selecting galaxies of rare or unique types that merit
individual study.  Looser cuts can be applied to obtain samples with a higher
level of completeness, although the rate of false positives must be closely
monitored.  We stress that the details of any selection process will vary based
on the particular science case; for example, \citet{bam09,ski09,sme15} all
demonstrate the advantages of using the vote fractions directly as weights
rather than applying discrete thresholds.

To select galaxies of a morphological type identified with a particular task, a
cut is placed on the vote fraction for that task ($f_{\rm task}$), \emph{as
well as} the vote fractions for the tasks preceding it, because of the
dependency induced by the decision-tree structure. For example, to select
barred galaxies, a cut may be placed on \fbar{} such that only galaxies where a
high fraction of votes for this task voted for the $bar,yes$ answer. This is
not the only necessary cut, however, since not all classifiers answer this question;
only those who have previously selected ``features'' in Task~01, ``not clumpy''
in Task~12, and ``not edge-on'' in Task~02 will have the opportunity to vote on
the bar question, Task~03. To ensure that \fbar{} is well-sampled, cuts on all
previous tasks must be applied. 

The flexibility of this catalog allows users to set their own selection
criteria for vote fraction thresholds to create a morphologically pure sample.
Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds} provides baseline cuts for selecting galaxies of a
variety of morphologies. These thresholds are determined by a visual inspection
of subsamples. The thresholds used are a combination of 20~votes for the
task being considered, as well as limits on the vote fractions for previous
response(s) in the decision tree. 

We visually analyzed subsamples of 50~galaxies meeting both
criteria, as well as a control sample of galaxies which had 20~classifiers vote on
the task, but did not meet the threshold cut set for the previous task. The
threshold cut was adjusted and new subsamples were inspected until both the
original and control samples achieved $>80\%$ purity.

As an example of how to use Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds} to create a sample of
3-armed spiral galaxies, we suggest selecting objects with $N_{arm~number} \ge
20$, \ffeatures$>0.23, f_{\rm clumpy,no} > 0.30, f_{edgeon,no}>0.25$, and
$f_{spiral,yes}>0.25$. These cuts define a sample of galaxies of ``arm number
candidates''; \ie, galaxies for which answering the arm number question makes
physical sense and the vote fraction $f_{\rm arm~number}$ is well-sampled. In
this example, such galaxies are featured, non-clumpy, non-edge~on spirals. At
this point a cut can be made on $f_{\rm arm~number=3}$ to select spirals with
three arms. 

Tasks 03, 04 and 05 have an additional possible pathway; as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:decisiontree}, a classifier might also be shown this question
if they select ``featured/disk'' in Task~01, ``clumpy'' in Task~12, two or more
clumps in Task~16, and ``spiral arrangement'' in Task~15. After applying
the appropriate thresholds for this path, $< 0.5\%$ of the galaxies which
have $\ge 20$ answers to these questions used this pathway to arrive at
these Tasks. None of these images show obvious disk
structure, although the clumps within are arranged in a spiral pattern. 

This section described how to use Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds} to select
galaxies for which a particular task is reliably sampled. The
following two examples extend this and show how to use the vote fractions to
obtain samples of galaxies with a specific morphological type.

\subsection{Example 1: Selecting barred galaxies} 

Bars in galaxies are a trace of the dynamical state of the disk
\citep[\eg,][]{com09a,ath12}. Disks which have significant vertical motions
typically do not form bars (with the exception of tidally triggered bars;
\citealt{bar91}), but once a disk settles to a thin, dynamically cool state,
the formation of bars proceeds quickly. Most theoretical predictions show that
bars are long-lasting in the absence of significant galaxy interactions
\citep{ath05}, so the fraction of bars in disk galaxies can measure the
dynamical maturity of that population. For this reason, tracking the fraction
of bars in disk galaxies as a function of redshift has attracted significant
interest since the first resolved images of high redshift galaxies were
obtained \citep[\eg,][]{abr99,elm04,jog04,she08a, mel14,sim14}.

We create a sample of barred disk galaxies in GZH by applying cuts on the previous
tasks in Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds}. We first identify 11,049 ``bar
candidates,'' which are disk galaxies that are sufficiently face-on to attempt
visual identification of a bar. These galaxies were selected by applying the cuts $N_{bar} \ge 20$,
$f_{\rm features}>0.23, f_{\rm clumpy,no} > 0.30,$ and $f_{edgeon,no}>0.25$.
These galaxies are featured, non-clumpy, non-edge~on galaxies. Of these, a pure
sample of 730~barred disks was identified by applying a cut of \fbar$>0.7$. A
subsample of 50~galaxies were visually inspected and 94\% were found to contain
strong bars. A complete sample of strong and weak bars was created by applying
a cut of \fbar$>0.3$.  This sample contained 3,218~galaxies, 86\% of which were
found to contain weak or strong bars through visual inspection.

The resulting bar sample can be used to estimate the redshift evolution of bar
fraction; we find a steady decrease of \fbar$\sim 0.32$ at $z=0.4$ to
\fbar$\sim 0.24$ at $z=1.0$. This decrease agrees with
\citet{mel14}, although they report a lower overall bar fraction going from
\fbar$=0.22$ at $z=0.4$ to \fbar$=0.11$ at $z=1.0$. The difference in total bar
fraction is expected, as this analysis used a looser cut on \fbar, there is no
luminosity cut, and the use of debiased values for \ffeatures{} increases the
total amount of disks in the sample compared to \citet{mel14}. However, the
results from GZH indicate that if features are reliably identified, the bar is
always visible; for galaxies at increasing redshifts, the disks fade first but
the galactic bar remains visible \citep{mel16}. As a result, we do \emph{not}
recommend using an evolving cut on \fbar{} as a function of redshift for the
selection of barred disks. 

Another existing study using GZH to select barred galaxies was presented in
\citet{che15}. This study used a slightly different bar sample selection to
demonstrate that AGN hosts show no statistically significant enhancement in bar
fraction or average bar likelihood compared to closely-matched inactive
galaxies. We note that their technique matched test and control galaxies over
the same redshift ranges, which minimizes the possible impact of redshift bias.

\subsection{Example 2: Identifying clump multiplicity} Clumps are known to be a
characteristic feature of galaxies at high redshift, and there is
evidence they play a crucial role in the evolution of modern spirals,
particularly in the formation of central bulges
\citep{elm05,elm14,guo15,beh16}. Simulations show clumps migrate from the outer
disk to the galactic center in only a few orbital periods \citep{man15} and
observations show increasing bulge to clump mass and density ratios as the
Universe evolves since $z\sim 1.5$ \citep{elm09}, suggesting that clumps
coalesce over time to form the modern bulges of disk galaxies. GZH includes a
``clumpy'' path in the decision tree for the purposes of identifying clumps
and investigating their evolution with redshift. 

For galaxies identified as ``clumpy'' in GZH, the number of clumps can be
determined using Task~16. Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds} can be used to select
8,444~galaxies measured as ``clumpy'' using \ffeatures$> 0.23$ and $f_{\rm
clumpy,yes}>0.80$ to ensure the vote fractions for Task~16 are well-sampled.
The clump number can be reasonably identified for 1,112 of the clumpy galaxies;
for the remainder, the unique clumps were less distinguishable from each other
and the exact number of clumps could not be deduced without careful visual
inspection. In the 1,112 which did have distinguishable clumps, there are
61 one-clump galaxies using $f_{\rm 1~clump}>0.50$, 442 two-clump galaxies
using $f_{\rm 2~clumps}>0.80$, 275 three-clump galaxies using $f_{\rm
3~clumps}>0.75$, 71 four-clump galaxies using $f_{\rm 4~clumps} > 0.70$,
and 263~galaxies with more than four clumps using $f_{\rm >4~clumps}>0.70$.
Alternatively, these data may be used to create more general samples of
clumpy galaxies with few clumps and many clumps. A sample of 989 ``few
clumps'' galaxies can be made using $(f_{\rm 1~clump} + f_{\rm 2~clumps}) >
0.5$ and 2,910 ``many clumps'' galaxies using $(f_{\rm 3~clumps}+f_{\rm
4~clumps}+f_{\rm >4~clumps})>0.5$.

\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

%\subsection{Effect of changing depth (GOODS, Stripe 82)}

\subsection{Demographics of morphology}

Any analysis of the morphological distribution of galaxies must properly
consider morphology with respect to other physical properties of the sample,
such as color, mass, size, environment, and redshift. We defer such analyses to
later papers, and comment here only on a few broad characteristics of the
overall GZH sample. 

Figure~\ref{fig:sankey} shows the breakdown of morphologies for the combined
surveys in GZH as a flow~diagram, where each node represents a task and the
flows between the nodes represent the possible responses. The width of the
flows is proportional to the number of galaxies associated with that response.
Figure~\ref{fig:sankey} uses a simple plurality vote to assign the combined set
of labels for each galaxy. This method is likely to undersample some of the
categories; visual inspection of images suggests that \ffeatures$\gtrsim0.3$
identifies disk-dominated or irregular galaxies reliably, for example. This
method also does not use the suggested thresholds in
Table~\ref{tbl:thresholds}. 

\begin{figure*}
\center
\includegraphics[width=0.90\textwidth]{figures/sankey_both.png}
\caption{Demographics of the morphologies for all galaxies in GZH (including
both \hst{} and SDSS imaging). Each node in each diagram (dark blue horizontal
bars of uniform height) represents a task in the tree. The left diagram shows
the full decision tree. The right diagram zooms in on the features/clumpy
tasks, which are otherwise difficult to see. The paths between tasks represent
each possible answer to the task, flowing from top to bottom between their
origin and the subsequent task in the tree. Labels are assigned to
each galaxy based on the plurality answer for each task. A galaxy is assigned
only one label at each node. Widths of the paths are proportional to the number
of galaxies assigned to that path. The widths of the nodes are proportional to
the number of galaxies for which the question was reliably answered.}
\label{fig:sankey}
\end{figure*}

Given these caveats, the overall distribution of galaxy types is significantly
different than the low-redshift sample classified in SDSS imaging from GZ1 and
GZ2. \citet{lin11} found that elliptical galaxies exceeded spiral galaxies by a
factor of $\sim2:1$ in their spectroscopic sample if using a plurality vote
criterion (although \citealt{bam09} show that this strongly depends on the
selection method; spirals are the dominant population in a volume-limited
sample at $z<0.088$, for example). The weighted votes for GZH have smooth
galaxies outnumbering disks and clumpy galaxies by a factor of $\sim3:1$,
however. The fraction of objects identified as stars or artifact is also much
higher in the \hst{} imaging. By plurality votes, these encompass only
$\sim0.1\%$ of images in SDSS \citep{wil13}, but 6\% of images in GZH. 

Within the sample of galaxies identified as ``not smooth'', it is clear that
the addition of the clumpy branch is necessary to describe a large fraction of
the sample, since disk-dominated galaxies outnumber clumpy morphologies by less than
a factor of 2. Disk galaxies are primarily unbarred \citet{mel14} and
possessing two visible spiral arms over a flat distribution of pitch angles and
bulge prominence. Clumpy galaxies are identified across the full range of clump
multiplicities, with the exception of 1-clump galaxies (which would be
difficult to differentiate from compact spheroids). Roughly half of the
galaxies have at least 1~clump identified as the brightest. Clumps are most
commonly asymmetrically arranged in clusters and are not often seen embedded in
larger structures. 

\subsection{Comparing GZH morphologies to other catalogs}\label{ssec:comparisons}

All of the Legacy surveys included in the GZH imaging have had morphological
catalogs previously published; these catalogs have significant differences in
the number of galaxies, size and magnitude limits, classification scheme, and
the methods used for measuring morphology. These catalogs have been
cross-matched to GZH to compare the results. This is not presented as an
endorsement of any particular method, but as an exploration of the strengths
and weaknesses of the Galaxy~Zoo crowdsourced catalogs compared to products
made with machine learning, automatic fits, and expert visual classification. 

The types and accuracy of morphological classification strongly depend on the
sample and methods being used. In an attempt to make a consistent comparison
between different techniques, galaxies are broadly grouped into three
categories: bulge-dominated/elliptical/smooth, disk-dominated/spiral, and
irregular/clumpy. These categories are compared to two parameters in GZH:
\fbest, which identifies disk-dominated and clumpy galaxies, and \fodd, which
identifies deviations from well-formed spirals or S0s and which constitutes a
``catch-all'' for the variety of asymmetric morphologies that can constitute an
irregular galaxy. 

The comparison and analysis of the GZH morphologies is done on a set of matched,
volume-limited samples at $z<1.0$ and $m_{I|i|z} < 22.5$~mag.  The redshift and
magnitude limits for the sample are chosen to match the shared constraints for
the shallowest depths \citep[GEMS;][]{bun05} and the limits on morphological
reliability \citep[COSMOS/ZEST;][]{sca07} in the comparison catalogs. We match
all catalogs against GZH using a positional radius of 0.5\arcsec.

Morphologies for GEMS galaxies were measured by \citet{hau07}, who used
single-component \sersic{} fits to the F850LP imaging. A 1\arcsec~positional
match for the GEMS galaxies in Table~9 in \citet{hau07} to the GZH sample gives
8,846~galaxies in both \citet{hau07} and GZH. The primary morphological
parameter in the automated catalog is the \sersic{} index $n$ defining the
radial surface brightness profile.  ``Elliptical'' galaxies are selected by
$n>2.5$ and ``spirals''  by $n<2.5$.  There is no automatic measurement of
irregular or clumpy structure. 

AEGIS galaxies were morphologically classified using non-parametric
measurements by \citet{lot08}. Their method used a combination of the Gini
coefficient ($G$), which measures the relative inequality in pixel brightness,
and $M_{20}$, the second-order moment of the brightest 20\% of the light
\citep{lot04}. A linear combination of $G$ and $M_{20}$ delineates three broad
categories of galaxy morphology: E/S0/Sa (``elliptical''), Sb/Sc/Ir
(``spiral''), and mergers (``irregular''). We limit the AEGIS galaxies to those
with reliably-measured morphologies and $S/N>3$ in both $V$- and $I$-bands in
\citet{lot08}. 

Galaxies in both of the GOODS fields down to a limit of $z_{AB}=22.5$ were
visually classified by a single expert (R.S.~Ellis), inspecting both $z$-band
and composite $Viz$ color images \citep{bun05}. These morphologies are assigned
a numerical value based on categories in \citet{bri98a}: the corresponding
morphologies used are ``elliptical'' (classes 0,1,2), ``spirals'' (classes
3,4,5), and ``irregular'' (classes 6,7,8).

COSMOS galaxies have multiple published datasets automatically classifying
morphology, all using a variation of non-parametric measurements. \citet{cas07}
used a combination of concentration ($C$), asymmetry ($A$), $G$, and $M_{20}$
\citep{cas05} make empirical divisions based on several hundred training images
to assign galaxy morphology. A similar method was employed by \citet{tas11},
using the same non-parametric indices but with a different method of
calculating the Petrosian radius and total light profile, and using a
nearest-neighbors method to label morphologies. \citet[][ZEST]{sca07} used $C$,
$A$, $G$, $M_{20}$, the galaxy ellipticity ($\epsilon$), and \sersic{} index
($n$) to quantify morphology; a principal component analysis is used to assign
galaxies to categories. All three methods use discrete morphological categories
of ellipticals, spirals, and peculiar/irregulars. We use the same categories
with the exception of assigning S0/bulge-dominated disks (type~2.0) from ZEST
into the early-type category.

\begin{figure*}
\center
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/comparisons_features.pdf}
\caption{Distributions of morphological parameters for a volume-limited sample
($z<1.0$, $m<22.5$) of galaxies matched between GZH and six published
morphological catalogs, split by survey (AEGIS, COSMOS, GEMS, and GOODS). This
plot shows the fraction of overall galaxies for each of the external
morphological categories as a function of \fbest{} in GZH. The shaded regions
around the binned fractions are confidence intervals calculated for a binomial
population \citep{cam11}.}
\label{fig:comparisons_features}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:comparisons_features} shows the proportion of galaxies as split
by their automated/expert visual morphologies for each of the six catalogs
matched to GZH. Galaxies from every catalog show a strong correlation between
\fbest{} and the fraction of galaxies identified as spirals, with a
corresponding anti-correlation between \fbest{} and the fraction of
ellipticals.

The AEGIS sample had the fewest number of matched galaxies (485) with GZH;
while the statistical uncertainties are as a result higher, the strongest
difference between spirals and early-types is seen at \fbest$>0.8$. GOODS
galaxies, which are the only comparison sample that also uses visual
morphology, shows a very similar trend, with nearly 100\% pure samples at
the lowest and highest values of \fbest.  Galaxies from GEMS (which are
only split into two types) also have a strong correlation with \fbest,
which is somewhat surprising (but encouraging) considering the known limits
of assigning galaxy morphology based only on a single \sersic{} parameter. 

Visual inspection of images of the exceptions --- where both \fbest{} and $n$
are high --- show that most are obvious spirals but with prominent bulges. This
means that the single-component \sersic{} fit is likely choosing too small of
an effective radius and missing the extended disk structure for a large
population of galaxies. This is a known issue with using $n$ as a standalone
measure of galaxy morphology -- it is relatively common, for example, to
measure high $n$ for an object with an exponential disk but a central cusp in
the light profile (eg, due to an AGN, cluster, foreground star, noise, etc).

Galaxies from the three COSMOS morphology catalogs all have morphologies that are
reasonably well-predicted by the GZH based on \fbest. The relation is strongest
for early-type galaxies, since the comparable fractions of irregulars and
spirals shows that clumpy/asymmetric morphologies are clearly also being
captured by the \fbest{} parameter. The small dropoff in the fraction of
early-types for the Cassata and ZEST samples at \fbest$<0.1$ is somewhat
puzzling, but could potentially be due to the presence of a small
population of extremely compact objects (stars or quasars) that would be
classified as artifacts in GZH, explaining the dip in \fbest.

%We also emphasize that the previously published COSMOS catalogs are not
%internally consistent; for example, only 64\% of the galaxies in \citet{tas11}
%have the same morphological class as \citet{cas07}. The bulk of these are
%galaxies classified as ``spiral'' using one technique and ``irregular'' using
%another (\citealt{cas07} is more likely to classify galaxies as irregular).  A
%detailed comparison of the external catalogs is outside the scope of this
%paper, but we emphasize only that it is \emph{impossible} for any catalog to be
%consistent with all three.  We interpret the broad agreements between
%early-types, spirals, and irregulars for all three samples as a validation of
%the crowdsourced visual classifications provided by GZH.

%\begin{figure*}
%\center
%\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/comparisons_odd.pdf}
%\caption{Same as Figure~\ref{fig:comparisons_features}, but comparing external
%morphologies to \fodd{} in GZH. Measurement of \fodd{} excludes galaxies
%labeled as ``odd'' due to lenses or dust lanes ($<1\%$ of the total), which are GZH
%categories not expected to correlate with larger-scale structural parameters.}
%\label{fig:comparisons_odd}
%\end{figure*}
%
%Figure~\ref{fig:comparisons_odd} analyzes the same sets of matched galaxies, but
%compares the data to the \fodd{} parameter in GZH to examine its correlation with
%irregular morphologies. The relationship in this case is less clear; for the
%COSMOS catalogs, in particular, early-types, spirals, and irregulars are
%roughly equally probable at \fodd$>0.5$. In both AEGIS and GOODS (there is no
%measurement of irregular structure for GEMS in \citealt{hau07}), the proportion
%of irregular galaxies does increase with \fodd. However, the actual number of
%galaxies at \fodd$>0.5$ is quite small ($N\lesssim100$) in both samples, and so
%estimating an accurate fraction is less precise.  We also note that this
%particular question ({\it ``anything odd?''}) has somewhat uncertain phrasing
%in GZH, and that the design of the tree explicitly separates clumpy from
%irregular or merging morphologies, which would have similar properties in
%automatic techniques. A more accurate selection of irregular morphologies in
%GZH should use a weighted combination of \fbest, \fclumpy, and \fodd.

A detailed comparison of the external catalogs is outside the scope of this
paper, but we emphasize only that it is impossible for any catalog to be fully
consistent with all of the previously published datasets (for example, only
64\% of the galaxies in \citealt{tas11} have the same morphological class as
the same galaxies in \citealt{cas07}). We interpret the broad agreements
between early-types, spirals, and irregulars between GZH and all three methods
of automated classification as a validation of both the crowdsourced visual
classifications provided by GZH and those automated methods.

It has been argued that automated methods are preferable to visual
classification due to being quantified and more easily reproducible
\citep[\eg,][]{con14,paw16}. We argue that this distinction applies only to
visual classification done by individual and/or small numbers of experts. The
technique of crowdsourcing using a large number of independent classifiers
provides visual classification which is both quantified, and reproducible, and
(as demonstrated in this section), broadly agrees with all the automated
methods and expert visual classifications.

We repeated all analyses comparing morphologies between GZH and external
catalogs on the entire catalog, rather than the volume-limited sample
($z<1.0,m<22.5$) discussed above. If galaxies at all redshifts and at the
original magnitude limit of $m<23.5$ are used, the correlations between all of
the automatic morphological populations and GZH decrease significantly.  The
exceptions are the GEMS galaxies, which are the only sample that was visually
classified and had a shallower magnitude cut on their catalog.
Based on these comparisons, we suggest that use of the GZH catalog be limited
to galaxies with $m_\mathrm{I|i|z}<22.5$; fainter targets at the sensitivity of the \hst{}
Legacy surveys have been demonstrated to be less reliable, regardless of the
method of morphological classification being used.

\subsection{Galaxy Zoo: Hubble and Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS}\label{ssec:gzh_gzc}

Finally, there are 7,681~galaxies in the GOODS-S field with morphological
classifications in both GZH and the Galaxy~Zoo:~CANDELS project (Simmons
et~al., submitted). Since both the sensitivity and filters for the two sets of
images are significantly different (and there is no correction for redshift
bias applied to GZC), there is no prior reason to expect a perfect correlation
between the separate vote fractions for the projects. Briefly, we note that the
\ffeatures{} value for GZH is on average higher than GZC; the effect is
strongest at $f_\mathrm{features,GZC}<0.3$, for which roughly half the galaxies
have $f_\mathrm{features,GZH}>0.5$. However, the correlation between vote
fractions is single-valued (although not linear, with a Pearson correlation
coefficient of $r=0.6$), and should be possible to calibrate using a similar
approach to that described in Section~\ref{sec:debiasing}; the correlation
between other tasks, such as edge-on galaxies is significantly stronger
($r=0.9$). So while the raw vote fractions are not directly comparable, the
initial analysis indicates that the broad morphologies are at least consistent.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

%Now people go and do science with these awesome GZH classifications. 

This paper presents the catalog release for the Galaxy Zoo Hubble project,
which uses crowdsourced visual classifications to measure galaxy morphologies.
The first two phases of Galaxy Zoo \citep{lin11,wil13} used images of
low-redshift galaxies from SDSS; this is the first result of the project with
space-based images of high-redshift targets (in addition to the Galaxy Zoo:
CANDELS collaboration; Simmons et al., submitted). The final sample includes
classifications for 189,149~images generated from 145,741~unique galaxies
(of which 115,402 are in \hst{} Legacy imaging).

Galaxies were selected from a brightness-limited sample from multiple Legacy
surveys using the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the \hubble,
including AEGIS, GEMS, GOODS-N, GOODS-S, and COSMOS. The catalog also includes
classifications for SDSS images from Stripe~82 at $z<0.25$; these images
serve both as a low-redshift anchor for
cosmological studies and a potential comparison for the different epochs of
classification between GZH and Galaxy Zoo 2 \citep{wil13}. 

The data for the GZH catalogs has been extensively tested and reduced. The
dominant effect is a known bias against identifying disky and asymmetric
sub-structures at either low resolution or surface brightness. This can be the
result either of genuinely small or dim galaxies, or a perceived effect from
observing galaxies at further distances (higher redshift). To calibrate this
\emph{without} potentially overcorrecting for the genuine morphological
evolution of galaxies over cosmic time, the GZH project uses SDSS images of
low-redshift galaxies, processes them to appear as if they were at higher
redshift, and classifies them through the GZH interface in an identical
fashion. The resulting change in \ffeatures{} as a function of $z$ and $\mu$ is
applied as a multiplicative correction to the top-level vote fractions for
$\sim50\%$ of the GZH galaxies. 

Galaxies in GZH show significant changes in the disk/elliptical fraction as a
function of redshift, along with an increasing number of galaxies dominated by
smaller clumps and presumed to be in the process of building up their baryonic
mass through a combination of hierarchical merging and {\it in-situ} star formation.
While the majority of scientific interpretation is left to future work, this
paper confirms the decrease in observed bar fraction with increasing redshift
and identifies a new way of selecting clumpy galaxies as a
function of clump multiplicity.

GZH used both 5-epoch and 2-epoch sets of data to construct the GOODS set of
images. The 11,157 full depth 5-epoch images are used in the \main{} catalog; the
classifications for the 6,144 \goods{} images are provided as a
supplementary table. This section analyzes the effect of image depth on the
ability of the Galaxy~Zoo classifiers to identify features or disk structure in the images. 

\subsection{Comparing shallow and full depth morphologies}\label{ssec:depth_comparison}

Of the 11,157 galaxies in the GOODS-N and GOODS-S full depth sample, 4,461
are also in the shallow-depth sample. Figure~\ref{fig:shallow_vs_full} shows a
strong correlation between \ffeatures{} for both sets of images. The mean
change in \ffeatures{} from the shallow to full depth images
$f_\mathrm{features,full} - f_{features,shallow} \equiv \Delta f = 0.00$, with
a standard deviation of $\sigma = 0.17$. While there is some variance in
$\Delta f$ in the whole sample, the change is usually small and not often
significant enough to change a morphological classification. Defining a clean
sample of disk galaxies as those with \fbest$>0.8$, elliptical galaxies as
those with $f_\mathrm{smooth,best}<0.2$, and intermediate as those in between,
75\% of the sample would not change morphology. Of the remaining 25\% that
would change morphology, only 0.3\% (10~galaxies)
drastically change morphology either from smooth to featured or vice versa, while the
rest transition to or from the ``intermediate'' morphology. Details can

\subsection{Debiasing higher-order tasks: \fbar}
\label{sec:ferengi_bar}

To determine the rate at which the vote fraction for any Task decreases with
redshift or surface brightness, data from simulated \ferengi{} images were
modeled with functions in discrete redshift and surface brightness bins
(Section~\ref{ssec:zeta_results}). A cut of $N>10$ was placed on the number of
votes to reduce the error in the vote fractions and ensure they were
well-sampled before applying a fit to the data. This requirement was only met
for Task~01, which significantly reduced the goodness-of-fit for the model
functions as compared to the smooth/features task. Here we show an
example of results obtained for the bar Task. Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_fbar}
shows that both the low sample rate and the degree of scatter in each bin
inhibit fitting a reliable function that predicts $f_{{\rm bar},z=0.3}$.
Table~\ref{tbl:ferengi_bar} summarizes the correction types for the
\ferengi{} data; 71\% of the galaxies simulated did not meet the GZH
requirements for well-sampled vote fractions for $f_\mathrm{bar}$, as
compared to 2\% for $f_\mathrm{features}$. Similar results were obtained
for all higher-order Tasks in GZH (Section~\ref{ssec:higher_order_tasks}).  

\begin{figure*}

\caption{Similar to Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_f}, showing effects of redshift bias
for 3,449~images in the \ferengi{} sample. Each point in a given redshift
and surface brightness bin represents a unique galaxy. The $y$-axis in each
bin is the \ffeatures{} value of the image of that galaxy redshifted to the
value corresponding to that redshift bin. The $x$-axis is the \ffeatures{}
value of the image of the same galaxy redshifted to $z=0.3$. The dashed
black lines represent the best-fit polynomials to the data in each square.
The solid black line represents \ffeaturesz=\ffeaturesrest. Regions in
which there is a single-valued relationship between \ffeatures{} at high
redshift and at $z=0.3$ are marked in white; those in which there is not
are blue, and those with not enough data ($N<5$) are gray. A larger version of
the bin outlined at $z=1.0$ and $20.3 < \mu < 21.0$ $\rm (mag/arcsec^2)$ is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:f_vs_fbar_zoom}. The mean normalized $\chi^2$ of the
change in vote fraction is 0.08. None of the correlations for higher-order
tasks (including bars) were applied to galaxies in the GZH catalog.}

non single-valued relationship (blue regions). NEI images had undetermined
relationships due to a lack of data ($N<5$) in their corresponding $z$-$\mu$
bins (gray regions). Only 17\% (maximum) of \ferengi{} galaxies in the sample
were considered ``correctable'', which is not sufficient to compute a $\zeta$
function applicable to the \hst{} data.   \label{tbl:ferengi_bar_corrections}}
